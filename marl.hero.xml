Revision 1.3  2004/04/22 17:04:55  cwulfman
replaced old refsdecl with part/subpart scheme to allow new hopper to
address whole poem. Probably (certainly) breaks anything depending on
sestyad.line reference (but I doubt it ever worked anyway).

<salute>To the Right Worshipfull, Sir Thomas Walsingham, Knight</salute>
</opener>
<p><lb/>Sir, wee thinke not our selves discharged of the dutie wee owe to our
<lb/>friend, when wee have brought the breathlesse bodie to the earth: for 
<lb/>albeit the eye there taketh his ever farwell of that beloved object, yet the
<lb/>impression of the man, that hath beene deare unto us, living an after 
<lb/>life in our memory, there putteth us in mind of farther obsequies due 
<lb/>unto the deceased. And namely of the performance of whatsoever we 
<lb/>may judge shal make to his living credit, and to the effecting of his <lb/>determinations prevented by the stroke of death. By these meditations 
<lb/>(as by an intellectuall will) I suppose my selfe executor to the unhappily <lb/>deceased author of this Poem, upon who knowing that in his lift time 
<lb/>you bestowed many kind favours, entertaining the parts of reckoning 
<lb/>and woorth which you found in him, with good countenance and liberall 
<lb/>affection: I cannot but see so far into the will of him dead, but what-
<lb/>soever issue of his brain should chance to come abroad, that the first
<lb/>breath it should take might be the gentle aire of your liking: for since 
<lb/>his selfe had ben accustomed therunto, it would proove more agreeable 
<lb/>and thriving to his right children, than any other foster countenance <lb/>whatsoever. At this time seeing that this unfinished Tragedy happens 
<lb/>under my hands to be imprinted; of a double duty, the one to your selfe, 
<lb/>the other to the deceased, I present the same to your most 
<lb/>favourable allowance, offring my utmost selfe 
<lb/>now and ever to bee readie, </p>

<head>Hero and Leander</head>

<argument><head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST SESTYAD</head>
<l><name>Heros</name> description and her Loves,</l>
<l>The Phane of <name>Venus</name>; where he moves</l>
<l>His worthie Love-suite, and attaines;</l>
<l>Whose blisse the wrath of Fates restraines,</l>
<l>For <name>Cupids</name> grace to <name>Mercurie</name>,</l>
<l>Which tale the Author doth implie.</l></argument>



<lg type="paragraph"><l>On <name>Hellespont</name> guiltie of True-loves blood,</l>
<l>In view and opposit two citties stood,</l>
<l>Seaborderers, disjoin'd by <name>Neptune</name> might:</l>
<l>The one <name>Abydos</name>, the other <name>Sestos</name> hight.</l>
<l>At <name>Sestos</name>, <name>Hero</name> dwelt; <name>Hero</name> the faire,</l>
<l>Whom young <name>Apollo</name> courted for her haire,</l>
<l>And offred as a dower his burning throne,</l>
<l>Where she should sit for men to gaze upon.</l>
<l>The outside of her garments were of lawne,</l>
<l>The lining, purple silke, with guilt starres drawne,</l>
<l>Her wide sleeves greene, and bordered with a grove,</l>
<l>Where <name>Venus</name> in her naked glory strove,</l>
<l>To please the carelesse and disdainfull eies,</l>
<l>Of proud <name>Adonis</name> that before her lies.</l>
<l>Her kirtle blew, whereon was many a staine,</l>
<l>Made with the blood of wretched Lovers slaine.</l>
<l>Upon her head she ware a myrtle wreath,</l>
<l>From whence her vaile reacht to the ground beneath.</l>
<l>Her vaile was artificiall flowers and leaves,</l>
<l>Whose workmanship both man and beast deceaves.</l>
<l>Many would praise the sweet smell as she past,</l>
<l>When t'was the odour which her breath foorth cast.</l>
<l>And there for honie, bees have sought in vaine,</l>
<l>And beat from thence, have lighted there againe.</l>
<l>About her necke hung chaines of peble stone,</l>
<l>Which lightned by her necke, like Diamonds shone.</l>
<l>She ware no gloves, for neither sunne nor wind</l>
<l>Would burne or parch her hands, but to her mind,</l>
<l>Or warme or coole them: for they tooke delite</l>
<l>To play upon those hands, they were so white.</l>
<l>Buskins of shels all silvered, used she,</l>
<l>And brancht with blushing corall to the knee;</l>
<l>Where sparrowes pearcht, of hollow pearle and gold,</l>
<l>Such as the world would woonder to behold:</l>
<l>Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fils,</l>
<l>Which as shee went would cherupe through the bils.</l>
<l>Some say, for her the fairest <name>Cupid</name> pyn'd,</l>
<l>And looking in her face, was strooken blind.</l>
<l>But this is true, so like was one the other,</l>
<l>As he imagyn'd <name>Hero</name> was his mother.</l>
<l>And oftentimes into her bosome flew,</l>
<l>About her naked necke his bare armes threw.</l>
<l>And laid his childish head upon her brest,</l>
<l>And with still panting rockt, there tooke his rest.</l>
<l>So lovely faire was <name>Hero</name>, <name>Venus</name> <name>Nun</name>,</l>
<l>As nature wept, thinking she was undone;</l>
<l>Because she tooke more from her than she left,</l>
<l>And of such wondrous beautie her bereft:</l>
<l>Therefore in signe her treasure suffred wracke,</l>
<l>Since <name>Heroes</name> time, hath halfe the world beene blacke.</l>
<l>Amorous <name>Leander</name>, beautifull and yoong,</l>
<l>(Whose tragedie divine <name>Musaeus</name> soong)</l>
<l>Dwelt at <name>Abidus</name>; since him, dwelt there none,</l>
<l>For whom succeeding times make greater mone.</l>
<l>His dangling tresses that were never shorne,</l>
<l>Had they beene cut, and unto <name>Colchos</name> borne,</l>
<l>Would have allur'd the vent'rous youth of <name>Greece</name>,</l>
<l>To hazard more, than for the golden Fleece.</l>
<l>Faire <name>Cinthia</name> wisht, his armes might be her spheare,</l>
<l>Greefe makes her pale, because she mooves not there.</l>
<l>His bodie was as straight as <name>Circes</name> wand,</l>
<l><name>Jove</name> might have sipt out <name>Nectar</name> from his hand.</l>
<l>Even as delicious meat is to the tast,</l>
<l>So was his necke in touching, and surpast</l>
<l>The white of <name>Pelops</name> shoulder. I could tell ye,</l>
<l>How smooth his brest was, and how white his bellie,</l>
<l>And whose immortall fingars did imprint,</l>
<l>That heavenly path, with many a curious dint,</l>
<l>That runs along his backe, but my rude pen,</l>
<l>Can hardly blazon foorth the loves of men,</l>
<l>Much lesse of powerfull gods. Let it suffise,</l>
<l>That my slacke muse, sings of <name>Leanders</name> eies,</l>
<l>Those Orient cheekes and lippes, exceeding his</l>
<l>That leapt into the water for a kis</l>
<l>Of his owne shadow, and despising many,</l>
<l>Died ere he could enjoy the love of any.</l>
<l>Had wilde <name>Hippolitus</name>, <name>Leander</name> seene,</l>
<l>Enamoured of his beautie had he beene,</l>
<l>His presence made the rudest paisant melt,</l>
<l>That in the vast uplandish countrie dwelt,</l>
<l>The barbarous <name>Thratian</name> soldier moov'd with nought,</l>
<l>Was moov'd with him, and for his favour sought.</l>
<l>Some swore he was a maid in mans attire,</l>
<l>For in his lookes were all that men desire,</l>
<l>A pleasant smiling cheeke, a speaking eye,</l>
<l>A brow for Love to banquet roiallye,</l>
<l>And such as knew he was a man would say,</l>
<l><name>Leander</name>, thou art made for amorous play:</l>
<l>Why art thou not in love and lov'd of all?</l>
<l>Though thou be faire, yet be not thine owne thrall.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>The men of wealthie <name>Sestos</name>, everie yeare,</l>
<l>(For his sake whom their goddesse held so deare,</l>
<l>Rose-cheekt <name>Adonis</name>) kept a solemne feast.</l>
<l>Thither resorted many a wandring guest,</l>
<l>To meet their loves; such as had none at all,</l>
<l>Came lovers home, from this great festivall.</l>
<l>For everie street like to a Firmament</l>
<l>Glistered with breathing stars, who where they went,</l>
<l>Frighted the melancholie earth, which deem'd,</l>
<l>Eternall heaven to burne, for so it seem'd,</l>
<l>As if another <name>Phaeton</name> had got</l>
<l>The guidance of the sunnes rich chariot.</l>
<l>But far above the loveliest, <name>Hero</name> shin'd,</l>
<l>And stole away th'inchaunted gazers mind,</l>
<l>For like Sea-nimphs inveigling harmony,</l>
<l>So was her beautie to the standers by.</l>
<l>Nor that night-wandring pale and watrie starre,</l>
<l>(When yawning dragons draw her thirling carre,</l>
<l>From <name>Latmus</name> mount up to the glomie skie,</l>
<l>Where crown'd with blazing light and majestie,</l>
<l>She proudly sits) more over-rules the flood,</l>
<l>Than she the hearts of those that neere her stood.</l>
<l>Even as, when gawdie Nymphs pursue the chace,</l>
<l>Wretched Ixions shaggie footed race,</l>
<l>Incenst with savage heat, gallop amaine,</l>
<l>From steepe Pine-bearing mountains to the plaine:</l>
<l>So ran the people foorth to gaze upon her,</l>
<l>And all that view'd her, were enamour'd on her.</l>
<l>And as in furie of a dreadfull fight,</l>
<l>Their fellowes being slaine or put to flight,</l>
<l>Poore soldiers stand with fear of death dead strooken,</l>
<l>So at her presence all surpris'd and tooken,</l>
<l>Await the sentence of her scornefull eies:</l>
<l>He whom she favours lives, the other dies.</l>
<l>There might you see one sigh, another rage,</l>
<l>And some (their violent passions to asswage)</l>
<l>Compile sharpe satyrs, but alas too late,</l>
<l>For faithfull love will never turne to hate.</l>
<l>And many seeing great princes were denied,</l>
<l>Pyn'd as they went, and thinking on her died.</l>
<l>On this feast day, O cursed day and hower,</l>
<l>Went <name>Hero</name> thorow <name>Sestos</name>, from her tower</l>
<l>To <name>Venus</name> temple, where unhappilye,</l>
<l>As after chaunc'd, they did each other spye.</l>
<l>So faire a church as this, had <name>Venus</name> none,</l>
<l>The wals were of discoloured <name>Jasper</name> stone,</l>
<l>Wherein was <name>Proteus</name> carved, and o'rehead,</l>
<l>A livelie vine of greene sea agget spread;</l>
<l>Where by one hand, light headed <name>Bacchus</name> hoong,</l>
<l>And with the other, wine from grapes Out wroong.</l>
<l>Of Christall shining faire, the pavement was,</l>
<l>The towne of <name>Sestos</name> cal'd it <name>Venus</name> glasse.</l>
<l>There might you see the gods in sundrie shapes,</l>
<l>Committing headdie ryots, incest, rapes:</l>
<l>For know, that underneath this radiant floure,</l>
<l>Was <name>Danaes</name> statue in a brazen tower,</l>
<l><name>Jove</name>, slylie stealing from his sisters bed,</l>
<l>To dallie with <name>Idalian Ganimed</name>:</l>
<l>And for his love <name>Europa</name>, bellowing loud,</l>
<l>And tumbling with the Rainbow in a cloud:</l>
<l>Blood-quaffing <name>Mars</name>, heaving the yron net,</l>
<l>Which limping <name>Vulcan</name> and his <name>Cyclops</name> set:</l>
<l>Love kindling fire, to burne such townes as <name>Troy</name>,</l>
<l><name>Sylvanus</name> weeping for the lovely boy</l>
<l>That now is turn'd into a <name>Cypres</name> tree,</l>
<l>Under whose shade the Wood-gods love to bee.</l>
<l>And in the midst a silver altar stood,</l>
<l>There <name>Hero</name> sacrificing turtles blood,</l>
<l>Vaild to the ground, vailing her eie-lids close,</l>
<l>And modestly they opened as she rose:</l>
<l>Thence flew Loves arrow with the golden head,</l>
<l>And thus <name>Leander</name> was enamoured.</l>
<l>Stone still he stood, and evermore he gazed,</l>
<l>Till with the fire that from his count'nance blazed,</l>
<l>Relenting <name>Heroes</name> gentle heart was strooke,</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Such force and vertue hath an amorous looke.</quote></l>
</lg>
<lg><l>It lies not in our power to love, or hate,</l>
<l>For will in us is over-rul'd by fate.</l>
<l>When two are stript, long ere the course begin,</l>
<l>We wish that one should loose, the other win.</l>
<l>And one especiallie doe we affect,</l>
<l>Of two gold Ingots like in each respect.</l>
<l>The reason no man knowes, let it suffise,</l>
<l>What we behold is censur'd by our eies.</l>
<l>Where both deliberat, the love is slight,</l>
<l>Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight?</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>He kneel'd, but unto her devoutly praid;</l>
<l>Chast <name>Hero</name> to her selfe thus softly said:</l>
<l>Were I the saint hee worships, I would heare him,</l>
<l>And as shee spake those words, came somewhat nere him.</l>
<l>He started up, she blusht as one asham'd;</l>
<l>Wherewith <name>Leander</name> much more was inflam'd.</l>
<l>He toucht her hand, in touching it she trembled,</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Love deepely grounded, hardly is dissembled.</quote></l>
<l>These lovers parled by the touch of hands,</l>
<l>True love is mute, and oft amazed stands.</l>
<l>Thus while dum signs their yeelding harts entangled,</l>
<l>The aire with sparkes of living fire was spangled,</l>
<l>And night deepe drencht in mystie <name>Acheron</name>,</l>
<l>Heav'd up her head, and halfe the world upon,</l>
<l>Breath'd darkenesse forth (darke night is <name>Cupids</name> day.)</l>
<l>And now begins <name>Leander</name> to display</l>
<l>Loves holy fire, with words, with sighs and teares,</l>
<l>Which like sweet musicke entred <name>Heroes</name> eares,</l>
<l>And yet at everie word shee turn'd aside,</l>
<l>And alwaies cut him off as he replide.</l>
<l>At last, like to a bold sharpe Sophister,</l>
<l>With chearefull hope thus he accosted her.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Faire creature, let me speake without offence,</l>
<l>I would my rude words had the influence,</l>
<l>To lead thy thoughts, as thy faire lookes doe mine,</l>
<l>Then shouldst thou bee his prisoner who is thine.</l>
<l>Be not unkind and faire, mishapen stuffe</l>
<l>Are of behaviour boisterous and ruffe.</l>
<l>O shun me not, but heare me ere you goe,</l>
<l>God knowes I cannot force love, as you doe.</l>
<l>My words shall be as spotlesse as my youth,</l>
<l>Full of simplicitie and naked truth.</l>
<l>This sacrifice (whose sweet perfume descending,</l>
<l>From <name>Venus</name> altar to your footsteps bending)</l>
<l>Doth testifie that you exceed her farre,</l>
<l>To whom you offer, and whose Nunne you are.</l>
<l>Why should you worship her? her you surpasse,</l>
<l>As much as sparkling Diamonds flaring glasse.</l>
<l>A Diamond set in lead his worth retaines,</l>
<l>A heavenly Nimph, belov'd of humane swaines,</l>
<l>Receives no blemish, but oft-times more grace,</l>
<l>Which makes me hope, although I am but base,</l>
<l>Base in respect of thee, divine and pure,</l>
<l>Dutifull service may thy love procure,</l>
<l>And I in dutie will excell all other,</l>
<l>As thou in beautie doest exceed Loves mother.</l>
<l>Nor heaven, nor thou, were made to gaze upon,</l>
<l>As heaven preserves all things, so save thou one.</l>
<l>A stately builded ship, well rig'd and tall,</l>
<l>The Ocean maketh more majesticall:</l>
<l>Why vowest thou then to live in <name>Sestos</name> here,</l>
<l>Who on Loves seas more glorious wouldst appeare?</l>
<l>Like untun'd golden strings all women are,</l>
<l>Which long time lie untoucht, will harshly jarre.</l>
<l>Vessels of Brasse oft handled, brightly shine,</l>
<l>What difference betwixt the richest mine</l>
<l>And basest mold, but use? for both not us'de,</l>
<l>Are of like worth. Then treasure is abus'de,</l>
<l>When misers keepe it; being put to lone,</l>
<l>In time it will returne us two for one.</l>
<l>Rich robes, themselves and others do adorne,</l>
<l>Neither themselves nor others, if not worne.</l>
<l>Who builds a pallace and rams up the gate,</l>
<l>Shall see it ruinous and desolate.</l>
<l>Ah simple <name>Hero</name>, learne thy selfe to cherish,</l>
<l>Lone women like to emptie houses perish.</l>
<l>Lesse sinnes the poore rich man that starves himselfe,</l>
<l>In heaping up a masse of drossie pelfe,</l>
<l>Than such as you: his golden earth remains,</l>
<l>Which after his disceasse, some other gains.</l>
<l>But this faire jem, sweet in the losse alone,</l>
<l>When you fleet hence, can be bequeath'd to none.</l>
<l>Or if it could, downe from th'enameld skie,</l>
<l>All heaven would come to claime this legacie,</l>
<l>And with intestine broiles the world destroy,</l>
<l>And quite confound natures sweet harmony.</l>
<l>Well therefore by the gods decreed it is,</l>
<l>We humane creatures should enjoy that blisse.</l>
<l>One is no number, mayds are nothing then,</l>
<l>Without the sweet societie of men.</l>
<l>Wilt thou live single still? one shalt thou bee,</l>
<l>Though never-singling <name>Hymen</name> couple thee.</l>
<l>Wild savages, that drinke of running springs,</l>
<l>Thinke water farre excels all earthly things:</l>
<l>But they that dayly tast neat wine, despise it.</l>
<l>Virginitie, albeit some highly prise it,</l>
<l>Compar'd with marriage, had you tried them both,</l>
<l>Differs as much, as wine and water doth.</l>
<l>Base boullion for the stampes sake we allow,</l>
<l>Even so for mens impression do we you.</l>
<l>By which alone, our reverend fathers say,</l>
<l>Women receave perfection everie way.</l>
<l>This idoll which you terme <name>Virginitie</name>,</l>
<l>Is neither essence subject to the eie,</l>
<l>No, nor to any one exterior sence,</l>
<l>Nor hath it any place of residence,</l>
<l>Nor is't of earth or mold celestiall,</l>
<l>Or capable of any forme at all.</l>
<l>Of that which hath no being, doe not boast,</l>
<l>Things that are not at all, are never lost.</l>
<l>Men foolishly doe call it vertuous,</l>
<l>What vertue is it that is borne with us?</l>
<l>Much lesse can honour bee ascrib'd thereto,</l>
<l>Honour is purchac'd by the deedes wee do.</l>
<l>Beleeve me <name>Hero</name>, honour is not wone,</l>
<l>Untill some honourable deed be done.</l>
<l>Seeke you for chastitie, immortall fame,</l>
<l>And know that some have wrong'd <name>Dianas</name> name?</l>
<l>Whose name is it, if she be false or not,</l>
<l>So she be faire, but some vile toongs will blot?</l>
<l>But you are faire (aye me) so wondrous faire,</l>
<l>So yoong, so gentle, and so debonaire,</l>
<l>As <name>Greece</name> will thinke, if thus you live alone,</l>
<l>Some one or other keepes you as his owne.</l>
<l>Then <name>Hero</name> hate me not, nor from me flie,</l>
<l>To follow swiftly blasting infamie.</l>
<l>Perhaps, thy sacred Priesthood makes thee loath,</l>
<l>Tell me, to whom mad'st thou that heedlesse oath?</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>To <name>Venus</name>, answered shee, and as shee spake,</l>
<l>Foorth from those two tralucent cesternes brake,</l>
<l>A streame of liquid pearle, which downe her face</l>
<l>Made milk-white paths, wheron the gods might trace</l>
<l>To <name>Joves</name> high court. Hee thus replide: The rites</l>
<l>In which Loves beauteous Empresse most delites,</l>
<l>Are banquets, Dorick musicke, midnight-revell,</l>
<l>Plaies, maskes, and all that stern age counteth evill.</l>
<l>Thee as a holy Idiot doth she scorne,</l>
<l>For thou in vowing chastitie, hast sworne</l>
<l>To rob her name and honour, and thereby</l>
<l>Commit'st a sinne far worse than perjurie.</l>
<l>Even sacrilege against her Deitie,</l>
<l>Through regular and formall puritie.</l>
<l>To expiat which sinne, kisse and shake hands,</l>
<l>Such sacrifice as this, <name>Venus</name> demands.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Thereat she smild, and did denie him so,</l>
<l>As put thereby, yet might he hope for mo.</l>
<l>Which makes him quickly re-enforce his speech,</l>
<l>And her in humble manner thus beseech.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Though neither gods nor men may thee deserve,</l>
<l>Yet for her sake whom you have vow'd to serve,</l>
<l>Abandon fruitlesse cold Virginitie,</l>
<l>The gentle queene of Loves sole enemie.</l>
<l>Then shall you most resemble <name>Venus</name> Nun,</l>
<l>When <name>Venus</name> sweet rites are perform'd and done.</l>
<l>Flint-brested <name>Pallas</name> joies in single life,</l>
<l>But <name>Pallas</name> and your mistresse are at strife.</l>
<l>Love <name>Hero</name> then, and be not tirannous,</l>
<l>But heale the heart, that thou hast wounded thus,</l>
<l>Nor staine thy youthfull years with avarice,</l>
<l>Faire fooles delight to be accounted nice.</l>
<l>The richest corne dies, if it be not reapt,</l>
<l>Beautie alone is lost, too warily kept.</l>
<l>These arguments he us'de, and many more,</l>
<l>Wherewith she yeelded, that was woon before.</l>
<l><name>Heroes</name> lookes yeelded, but her words made warre,</l>
<l>Women are woon when they begin to jarre.</l>
<l>Thus having swallow'd <name>Cupids</name> golden hooke,</l>
<l>The more she striv'd, the deeper was she strooke.</l>
<l>Yet evilly faining anger, strove she still,</l>
<l>And would be thought to graunt against her will.</l>
<l>So having paus'd a while, at last shee said:</l>
<l>Who taught thee Rhethoricke to deceive a maid?</l>
<l>Aye me, such words as these should I abhor,</l>
<l>And yet I like them for the Orator.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>With that <name>Leander</name> stoopt, to have imbrac'd her,</l>
<l>But from his spreading armes away she cast her,</l>
<l>And thus bespake him: Gentle youth forbeare</l>
<l>To touch the sacred garments which I weare.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Upon a rocke, and underneath a hill,</l>
<l>Far from the towne (where all is whist and still,</l>
<l>Save that the sea playing on yellow sand,</l>
<l>Sends foorth a ratling murmure to the land,</l>
<l>Whose sound allures the golden <name>Morpheus</name>,</l>
<l>In silence of the night to visite us,)</l>
<l>My turret stands, and there God knowes I play</l>
<l>With <name>Venus</name> swannes and sparrowes all the day.</l>
<l>A dwarfish beldame beares me companie,</l>
<l>That hops about the chamber where I lie,</l>
<l>And spends the night (that might be better spent)</l>
<l>In vaine discourse, and apish merriment.</l>
<l>Come thither; As she spake this, her toong tript,</l>
<l>For unawares <quote>(Come thither)</quote> from her slipt,</l>
<l>And sodainly her former colour chang'd,</l>
<l>And here and there her eies through anger rang'd.</l>
<l>And like a planet, mooving severall wales,</l>
<l>At one selfe instant, she poore soule assaies,</l>
<l>Loving, not to love at all, and everie part</l>
<l>Strove to resist the motions of her hart.</l>
<l>And hands so pure, so innocent, nay such,</l>
<l>As might have made heaven stoope to have a touch,</l>
<l>Did she uphold to <name>Venus</name>, and againe,</l>
<l>Vow'd spotlesse chastitie, but all in vaine.</l>
<l><name>Cupid</name> beats downe her praiers with his wings,</l>
<l>Her vowes above the emptie aire he flings:</l>
<l>All deepe enrag'd, his sinowie bow he bent,</l>
<l>And shot a shaft that burning from him went,</l>
<l>Wherewith she strooken, look'd so dolefully,</l>
<l>As made Love sigh, to see his tirannie.</l>
<l>And as she wept, her teares to pearle he turn'd,</l>
<l>And wound them on his arme, and for her mourn'd:</l>
<l>Then towards the pallace of the Destinies,</l>
<l>Laden with languishment and griefe he flies.</l>
<l>And to those sterne nymphs humblie made request,</l>
<l>Both might enjoy ech other, and be blest.</l>
<l>But with a ghastly dreadfull countenaunce,</l>
<l>Threatning a thousand deaths at everie glaunce,</l>
<l>They answered Love, nor would vouchsafe so much</l>
<l>As one poore word, their hate to him was such.</l>
<l>Harken a while, and I will tell you why:</l>
<l>Heavens winged herrald, <name>Jove-borne Mercury</name>,</l>
<l>The self-same day that he asleepe had layd</l>
<l>Inchaunted <name>Argus</name>, spied a countrie mayd,</l>
<l>Whose carelesse haire, in stead of pearle t'adorne it,</l>
<l>Glist'red with deaw, as one that seem'd to skorne it:</l>
<l>Her breath as fragrant as the morning rose,</l>
<l>Her mind pure, and her toong untaught to glose.</l>
<l>Yet prowd she was, (for loftie pride that dwels</l>
<l>In tow'red courts, is oft in sheapheards cels.)</l>
<l>And too too well the faire vermilion knew,</l>
<l>And silver tincture of her cheekes, that drew</l>
<l>The love of everie swaine: On her, this god</l>
<l>Enamoured was, and with his snakie rod,</l>
<l>Did charme her nimble feet, and made her stay,</l>
<l>The while upon a hillocke downe he lay,</l>
<l>And sweetly on his pipe began to play,</l>
<l>And with smooth speech, her fancie to assay,</l>
<l>Till in his twining armes he lockt her fast,</l>
<l>And then he woo'd with kisses, and at last,</l>
<l>As sheap-heards do, her on the ground hee layd,</l>
<l>And tumbling in the grasse, he often strayd</l>
<l>Beyond the bounds of shame, in being bold</l>
<l>To eie those parts, which no eie should behold.</l>
<l>And like an insolent commaunding lover,</l>
<l>Boasting his parentage, would needs discover</l>
<l>The way to new <name>Elisium</name>: but she,</l>
<l>Whose only dower was her chastitie,</l>
<l>Having striv'ne in vaine, was now about to crie,</l>
<l>And crave the helpe of sheap-heards that were nie.</l>
<l>Herewith he stayd his furie, and began</l>
<l>To give her leave to rise: away she ran,</l>
<l>After went <name>Mercurie</name>, who us'd such cunning,</l>
<l>As she to heare his tale, left off her running.</l>
<l>Maids are not woon by brutish force and might,</l>
<l>But speeches full of pleasure and delight.</l>
<l>And knowing <name>Hermes</name> courted her, was glad</l>
<l>That she such lovelinesse and beautie had</l>
<l>As could provoke his liking, yet was mute,</l>
<l>And neither would denie, nor graunt his sute.</l>
<l>Still vowd he love, she wanting no excuse</l>
<l>To feed him with delaies, as women use:</l>
<l>Or thirsting after immortalitie,</l>
<l>All women are ambitious naturallie:</l>
<l>Impos'd upon her lover such a taske,</l>
<l>As he ought not performe, nor yet she aske.</l>
<l>A draught of flowing <name>Nectar</name>, she requested,</l>
<l>Wherewith the king of Gods and men is feasted.</l>
<l>He readie to accomplish what she wil'd,</l>
<l>Stole some from <name>Hebe</name> (<name>Hebe</name>, <name>Joves</name> cup fil'd,)</l>
<l>And gave it to his simple rustike love,</l>
<l>Which being knowne (as what is hid from <name>Jove</name>?)</l>
<l>He inly storm'd, and waxt more furious,</l>
<l>Than for the fire filcht by <name>Prometheus</name>;</l>
<l>And thrusts him down from heaven: he wandring here,</l>
<l>In mournfull tearmes, with sad and heavie cheare</l>
<l>Complaind to <name>Cupid</name>; <name>Cupid</name> for his sake,</l>
<l>To be reveng'd on <name>Jove</name>, did undertake,</l>
<l>And those on whom heaven, earth, and hell relies,</l>
<l>I mean the Adamantine Destinies,</l>
<l>He wounds with love, and forst them equallie,</l>
<l>To dote upon deceitfull <name>Mercurie</name>.</l>
<l>They offred him the deadly fatall knife,</l>
<l>That sheares the slender threads of humane life,</l>
<l>At his faire feathered feet, the engins layd,</l>
<l>Which th'earth from ougly <name>Chaos</name> den up-wayd:</l>
<l>These he regarded not, but did intreat,</l>
<l>That <name>Jove</name>, usurper of his fathers seat,</l>
<l>Might presently be banisht into hell,</l>
<l>And aged <name>Saturne</name> in <name>Olympus</name> dwell.</l>
<l>They granted what he crav'd, and once againe,</l>
<l><name>Saturne</name> and <name>Ops</name>, began their golden raigne.</l>
<l>Murder, rape, warre, lust and trecherie,</l>
<l>Were with <name>Jove</name> clos'd in <name>Stigian</name> Emperie.</l>
<l>But long this blessed time continued not;</l>
<l>As soone as he his wished purpose got,</l>
<l>He recklesse of his promise, did despise</l>
<l>The love of th'everlasting Destinies.</l>
<l>They seeing it, both Love and him abhor'd,</l>
<l>And <name>Jupiter</name> unto his place restor'd.</l>
<l>And but that Learning, in despight of Fate,</l>
<l>Will mount aloft, and enter heaven gate,</l>
<l>And to the seat of <name>Jove</name> it selfe advaunce,</l>
<l><name>Hermes</name> had slept in hell with ignoraunce.</l>
<l>Yet as a punishment they added this,</l>
<l>That he and <name>Povertie</name> should alwaies kis.</l>
<l>And to this day is everie scholler poore,</l>
<l>Grosse gold, from them runs headlong to the boore.</l>
<l>Likewise the angrie sisters thus deluded,</l>
<l>To venge themselves on <name>Hermes</name>, have concluded</l>
<l>That <name>Midas</name> brood shall sit in Honors chaire,</l>
<l>To which the <name>Muses</name> sonnes are only heire:</l>

<l>But be surpris'd with every garish toy.</l>
<l>And still inrich the loftie servile clowne,</l>
<l>Who with incroching guile, keepes learning downe.</l>
<l>Then muse not, <name>Cupids</name> sute no better sped,</l>

<argument><head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND SESTYAD</head>
<l><name>Hero</name> of love takes deeper sence,</l>
<l>And doth her love more recompence.</l>
<l>Their first nights meeting, where sweet kisses</l>
<l>Are th'only crownes of both their blisses.</l>
<l>He swims t'<name>Abydus</name>, and returnes;</l>
<l>Cold <name>Neptune</name>with his beautie burnes,</l>
<l>Whose suite he shuns, and doth aspire</l>
<l><name>Heros</name> faire towre, and his desire.</l></argument>

<lg><l>By this, sad <name>Hero</name>, with love unacquainted,</l>
<l>Viewing <name>Leanders</name> face, fell downe and fainted.</l>
<l>He kist her, and breath'd life into her lips,</l>
<l>Wherewith as one displeas'd, away she trips.</l>
<l>Yet as she went, full often look'd behind,</l>
<l>And many poore excuses did she find,</l>
<l>To linger by the way, and once she stayd,</l>
<l>And would have turn'd againe, but was afrayd,</l>
<l>In offring parlie, to be counted light.</l>
<l>So on she goes, and in her idle flight,</l>
<l>Her painted fanne of curled plumes let fall,</l>
<l>Thinking to traine <name>Leander</name> therewithall.</l>
<l>He being a novice, knew not what she meant,</l>
<l>But stayd, and after her a letter sent.</l>
<l>Which joyfull <name>Hero</name> answerd in such sort,</l>
<l>As he had hope to scale the beauteous fort,</l>
<l>Wherein the liberall graces lock'd their wealth,</l>
<l>And therefore to her tower he got by stealth.</l>
<l>Wide open stood the doore, hee need not clime,</l>
<l>And she her selfe before the pointed time,</l>
<l>Had spread the boord, with roses strowed the roome,</l>
<l>And oft look't out, and mus'd he did not come.</l>
<l>At last he came, O who can tell the greeting,</l>
<l>These greedie lovers had, at their first meeting.</l>
<l>He askt, she gave, and nothing was denied,</l>
<l>Both to each other quickly were affied.</l>
<l>Looke how their hands, so were their hearts united,</l>
<l>And what he did, she willingly requited.</l>
<l>(Sweet are the kisses, the imbracements sweet,</l>
<l>When like desires and affections meet,</l>
<l>For from the earth to heaven, is <name>Cupid</name> rais'd,</l>
<l>Where fancie is in equall ballance pais'd.)</l>
<l>Yet she this rashnesse sodainly repented,</l>
<l>And turn'd aside, and to her selfe lamented.</l>
<l>As if her name and honour had beene wrong'd,</l>
<l>By being possest of him for whom she long'd:</l>
<l>I, and shee wisht, albeit not from her hart,</l>
<l>That he would leave her turret and depart.</l>
<l>The mirthfull God of amorous pleasure smil'd,</l>
<l>To see how he this captive Nymph beguil'd.</l>
<l>For hitherto hee did but fan the fire,</l>
<l>And kept it downe that it might mount the hier.</l>
<l>Now waxt she jealous, least his love abated,</l>
<l>Fearing her owne thoughts made her to be hated.</l>
<l>Therefore unto him hastily she goes,</l>
<l>And like light <name>Salmacis</name>, her body throes</l>
<l>Upon his bosome, where with yeelding eyes,</l>
<l>She offers up her selfe a sacrifice,</l>
<l>To slake his anger, if he were displeas'd,</l>
<l>O what god would not therewith be appeas'd?</l>
<l>Like <name>Aesops</name> cocke, this jewell he enjoyed,</l>
<l>And as a brother with his sister toyed,</l>
<l>Supposing nothing else was to be done,</l>
<l>Now he her favour and good will had wone.</l>
<l>But know you not that creatures wanting sence,</l>
<l>By nature have a mutuall appetence,</l>
<l>And wanting organs to advaunce a step,</l>
<l>Mov'd by Loves force, unto ech other lep?</l>
<l>Much more in subjects having intellect,</l>
<l>Some hidden influence breeds like effect.</l>
<l>Albeit <name>Leander</name> rude in love, and raw,</l>
<l>Long dallying with <name>Hero</name>, nothing saw</l>
<l>That might delight him more, yet he suspected</l>
<l>Some amorous rites or other were neglected.</l>
<l>Therefore unto his bodie, hirs he clung,</l>
<l>She, fearing on the rushes to be flung,</l>
<l>Striv'd with redoubled strength: the more she strived,</l>
<l>The more a gentle pleasing heat revived,</l>
<l>Which taught him all that elder lovers know,</l>
<l>And now the same gan so to scorch and glow,</l>
<l>As in plaine termes (yet cunningly) he crav'd it,</l>
<l>Love alwaies makes those eloquent that have it.</l>
<l>Shee, with a kind of graunting, put him by it,</l>
<l>And ever as he thought himselfe most nigh it,</l>
<l>Like to the tree of <name>Tantalus</name> she fled,</l>
<l>And seeming lavish, sav'de her maydenhead.</l>
<l>Ne're king more sought to keepe his diademe,</l>
<l>Than <name>Hero</name> this inestimable gemme.</l>
<l>Above our life we love a stedfast friend,</l>
<l>Yet when a token of great worth we send,</l>
<l>We often kisse it, often looke thereon,</l>
<l>And stay the messenger that would be gon:</l>
<l>No marvell then, though <name>Hero</name> would not yeeld</l>
<l>So soone to part from that she deerely held.</l>
<l>Jewels being lost are found againe, this never,</l>
<l>T'is lost but once, and once lost, lost for ever.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Now had the morne espy'de her lovers steeds,</l>
<l>Whereat she starts, puts on her purple weeds,</l>
<l>And red for anger that he stayd so long,</l>
<l>All headlong throwes her selfe the clouds among</l>
<l>And now <name>Leander</name> fearing to be mist,</l>
<l>Imbrast her sodainly, tooke leave, and kist,</l>
<l>Long was he taking leave, and loath to go,</l>
<l>And kist againe, as lovers use to do.</l>
<l>Sad <name>Hero</name> wroong him by the hand, and wept,</l>
<l>Saying, let your vowes and promises be kept.</l>
<l>Then standing at the doore, she turnd about,</l>
<l>As loath to see <name>Leander</name> going out.</l>
<l>And now the sunne that through th'orizon peepes,</l>
<l>As pittying these lovers, downeward creepes.</l>
<l>So that in silence of the cloudie night,</l>
<l>Though it was morning, did he take his flight.</l>
<l>But what the secret trustie night conceal'd,</l>
<l><name>Leanders</name> amorous habit soone reveal'd.</l>
<l>With <name>Cupids</name> myrtle was his bonet crownd,</l>
<l>About his armes the purple riband wound,</l>
<l>Wherewith she wreath'd her largely spreading heare,</l>
<l>Nor could the youth abstaine, but he must weare</l>
<l>The sacred ring wherewith she was endow'd,</l>
<l>When first religious chastitie she vow'd:</l>
<l>Which made his love through <name>Sestos</name> to bee knowne,</l>
<l>And thence unto <name>Abydus</name> sooner blowne,</l>
<l>Than he could saile, for incorporeal Fame,</l>
<l>Whose waight consists in nothing but her name,</l>
<l>Is swifter than the wind, whose tardie plumes,</l>
<l>Are reeking water, and dull earthlie fumes.</l>
<l>Home when he came, he seem'd not to be there,</l>
<l>But like exiled aire thrust from his sphere,</l>
<l>Set in a forren place, and straight from thence,</l>
<l><name>Alcides</name> like, by mightie violence,</l>
<l>He would have chac'd away the swelling maine,</l>
<l>That him from her unjustly did detaine.</l>
<l>Like as the sunne in a Dyameter,</l>
<l>Fires and inflames objects remooved farre,</l>
<l>And heateth kindly, shining lat'rally;</l>
<l>So beautie, sweetly quickens when t'is ny,</l>
<l>But being separated and remooved,</l>
<l>Burnes where it cherisht, murders where it loved.</l>
<l>Therefore even as an Index to a booke,</l>
<l>So to his mind was yoong <name>Leanders</name> looke.</l>
<l>O none but gods have power their love to hide,</l>
<l>Affection by the count'nance is descride.</l>
<l>The light of hidden fire it selfe discovers,</l>
<l>And love that is conceal'd, betraies poore lovers.</l>
<l>His secret flame apparantly was seene,</l>
<l><name>Leanders</name> Father knew where hee had beene,</l>
<l>And for the same mildly rebuk't his sonne,</l>
<l>Thinking to quench the sparckles new begonne.</l>
<l>But love resisted once, growes passionate,</l>
<l>And nothing more than counsaile, lovers hate.</l>
<l>For as a hote prowd horse highly disdaines,</l>
<l>To have his head control'd, but breakes the raines,</l>
<l>Spits foorth the ringled bit, and with his hoves,</l>
<l>Checkes the submissive ground: so hee that loves,</l>
<l>The more he is restrain'd, the woorse he fares,</l>
<l>What is it now, but mad <name>Leander</name> dares?</l>
<l>O <name>Hero</name>, <name>Hero</name>, thus he cry'de full oft,</l>
<l>And then he got him to a rocke aloft.</l>
<l>Where having spy'de her tower, long star'd he on't,</l>
<l>And pray'd the narrow toyling <name>Hellespont</name>,</l>
<l>To part in twaine, that hee might come and go,</l>
<l>But still the rising billowes answered no.</l>
<l>With that hee stript him to the yv'rie skin,</l>
<l>And crying, Love I come, leapt lively in.</l>
<l>Whereat the saphir visag'd god grew prowd,</l>
<l>And made his capring <name>Triton</name> sound alowd,</l>
<l>Imagining, that <name>Ganimed</name> displeas'd,</l>
<l>Had left the heavens, therefore on him hee seaz'd.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> striv'd, the waves about him wound,</l>
<l>And puld him to the bottome, where the ground</l>
<l>Was strewd with pearle, and in low corrall groves,</l>
<l>Sweet singing Meremaids, sported with their loves</l>
<l>On heapes of heavie gold, and tooke great pleasure,</l>
<l>To spurne in carelesse sort, the shipwracke treasure.</l>
<l>For here the stately azure pallace stood,</l>
<l>Where kingly <name>Neptune</name> and his traine abode.</l>
<l>The lustie god imbrast him, cald him love,</l>
<l>And swore he never should returne to <name>Jove</name>.</l>
<l>But when he knew it was not <name>Ganimed</name>,</l>
<l>For under water he was almost dead,</l>
<l>He heav'd him up, and looking on his face,</l>
<l>Beat downe the bold waves with his triple mace,</l>
<l>Which mounted up, intending to have kist him,</l>
<l>And fell in drops like teares, because they mist him.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> being up, began to swim,</l>
<l>And looking backe, saw <name>Neptune</name> follow him.</l>
<l>Whereat agast, the poore soule gan to crie,</l>
<l>O let mee visite <name>Hero</name> ere I die.</l>
<l>The god put <name>Helles</name> bracelet on his arme,</l>
<l>And swore the sea should never doe him harme.</l>
<l>He clapt his plumpe cheekes, with his tresses playd,</l>
<l>And smiling wantonly, his love bewrayd.</l>
<l>He watcht his armes, and as they opend wide,</l>
<l>At every stroke, betwixt them would he slide,</l>
<l>And steale a kisse, and then run out and daunce,</l>
<l>And as he turnd, cast many a lustfull glaunce,</l>
<l>And throw him gawdie toies to please his eie,</l>
<l>And dive into the water, and there prie</l>
<l>Upon his brest, his thighs, and everie lim,</l>
<l>And up againe, and close beside him swim,</l>
<l>And talke of love: <name>Leander</name> made replie,</l>
<l>You are deceav'd, I am no woman I.</l>
<l>Thereat smilde <name>Neptune</name>, and then told a tale,</l>
<l>How that a sheapheard sitting in a vale,</l>
<l>Playd with a boy so faire and so kind,</l>
<l>As for his love, both earth and heaven pyn'd;</l>
<l>That of the cooling river durst not drinke,</l>
<l>Least water-nymphs should pull him from the brinke.</l>
<l>And when hee sported in the fragrant lawnes,</l>
<l>Gote-footed Satyrs, and up-staring Fawnes,</l>
<l>Would steale him thence. Ere halfe this tale was done,</l>
<l>Aye me, <name>Leander</name> cryde, th'enamoured sunne,</l>
<l>That now should shine on <name>Thetis</name> glassie bower,</l>
<l>Descends upon my radiant <name>Heroes</name> tower.</l>
<l>O that these tardie armes of mine were wings,</l>
<l>And as he spake, upon the waves he springs.</l>
<l><name>Neptune</name> was angrie that hee gave no eare,</l>
<l>And in his heart revenging malice bare:</l>
<l>He flung at him his mace, but as it went,</l>
<l>He cald it in, for love made him repent.</l>
<l>The mace returning backe, his owne hand hit,</l>
<l>As meaning to be veng'd for darting it.</l>
<l>When this fresh bleeding wound <name>Leander</name> viewd,</l>
<l>His colour went and came, as if he rewd</l>
<l>The greefe which <name>Neptune</name> felt. In gentle brests,</l>
<l>Relenting thoughts, remorse and pittie rests.</l>
<l>And who have hard hearts, and obdurat minds,</l>
<l>But vicious, harebraind, and illit'rat hinds?</l>
<l>The god seeing him with pittie to be moved,</l>
<l>Thereon concluded that he was beloved.</l>
<l>(Love is too full of faith, too credulous,</l>
<l>With follie and false hope deluding us.)</l>
<l>Wherefore <name>Leanders</name> fancie to surprize,</l>
<l>To the rich <name>Ocean</name> for gifts he flies.</l>
<l>'Tis wisedome to give much, a gift prevailes,</l>
<l>When deepe perswading Oratorie failes.</l>
<l>By this <name>Leander</name> being nere the land,</l>
<l>Cast downe his wearie feet, and felt the sand.</l>
<l>Breathlesse albeit he were, he rested not,</l>
<l>Till to the solitarie tower he got.</l>
<l>And knockt and cald, at which celestiall noise,</l>
<l>The longing heart of <name>Hero</name> much more joies</l>
<l>Then nymphs and sheapheards, when the timbrell rings,</l>
<l>Or crooked Dolphin when the sailer sings;</l>
<l>She stayd not for her robes, but straight arose,</l>
<l>And drunke with gladnesse, to the dore she goes.</l>
<l>Where seeing a naked man, she scriecht for feare,</l>
<l>Such sights as this, to tender maids are rare.</l>
<l>And ran into the darke her selfe to hide,</l>
<l>Rich jewels in the darke are soonest spide.</l>
<l>Unto her was he led, or rather drawne,</l>
<l>By those white limmes, which sparckled through the lawne.</l>
<l>The neerer that he came, the more she fled,</l>
<l>And seeking refuge, slipt into her bed.</l>
<l>Whereon <name>Leander</name> sitting, thus began,</l>
<l>Through numming cold, all feeble, faint and wan:</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>If not for love, yet love for pittie sake,</l>
<l>Me in thy bed and maiden bosome take,</l>
<l>At least vouchsafe these armes some little roome,</l>
<l>Who hoping to imbrace thee, cherely swome.</l>
<l>This head was beat with manie a churlish billow,</l>
<l>And therefore let it rest upon thy pillow.</l>
<l>Herewith afrighted <name>Hero</name> shrunke away,</l>
<l>And in her luke-warme place <name>Leander</name> lay.</l>
<l>Whose lively heat like fire from heaven fet,</l>
<l>Would animate grosse clay, and higher set</l>
<l>The drooping thoughts of base declining soules,</l>
<l>Then drerie <name>Mars</name>, carowsing <name>Nectar</name> boules.</l>
<l>His hands he cast upon her like a snare,</l>
<l>She overcome with shame and sallow feare,</l>
<l>Like chast <name>Diana</name>, when <name>Acteon</name> spyde her,</l>
<l>Being sodainly betraide, dyv'd downe to hide her.</l>
<l>And as her silver body downeward went,</l>
<l>With both her hands she made the bed a tent,</l>
<l>And in her owne mind thought her selfe secure,</l>
<l>O'recast with dim and darksome coverture.</l>
<l>And now she lets him whisper in her eare,</l>
<l>Flatter, intreat, promise, protest and sweare,</l>
<l>Yet ever as he greedily assayd</l>
<l>To touch those dainties, she the <name>Harpey</name> playd,</l>
<l>And every lim did as a soldier stout,</l>
<l>Defend the fort, and keep the foe-man out.</l>
<l>For though the rising yv'rie mount he scal'd,</l>
<l>Which is with azure circling lines empal'd,</l>
<l>Much like a globe, (a globe may I tearme this,</l>
<l>By which love sailes to regions full of blis,)</l>
<l>Yet there with <name>Sysiphus</name> he toyld in vaine,</l>
<l>Till gentle parlie did the truce obtaine.</l>
<l>Wherein <name>Leander</name> on her quivering brest,</l>
<l>Breathlesse spoke some thing, and sigh'd out the rest;</l>
<l>Which so prevail'd, as he with small ado,</l>
<l>Inclos'd her in his armes and kist her to.</l>
<l>And everie kisse to her was as a charme,</l>
<l>And to <name>Leander</name> as a fresh alarme.</l>
<l>So that the truce was broke, and she alas,</l>
<l>(Poore sillie maiden) at his mercie was.</l>
<l>Love is not ful of pittie (as men say)</l>
<l>But deaffe and cruell, where he meanes to pray.</l>
<l>Even as a bird, which in our hands we wring,</l>
<l>Foorth plungeth, and oft flutters with her wing,</l>
<l>She trembling strove, this strife of hers (like that</l>
<l>Which made the world) another world begat,</l>
<l>Of unknowne joy. Treason was in her thought,</l>
<l>And cunningly to yeeld her selfe she sought.</l>
<l>Seeming not woon, yet woon she was at length,</l>
<l>In such warres women use but halfe their strength.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> now like Theban <name>Hercules</name>,</l>
<l>Entred the orchard of <name>Th'esperides</name>,</l>
<l>Whose fruit none rightly can describe, but hee</l>
<l>That puls or shakes it from the golden tree:</l>
<l>And now she wisht this night were never done,</l>
<l>And sigh'd to thinke upon th'approching sunne,</l>
<l>For much it greev'd her that the bright day-light,</l>
<l>Should know the pleasure of this blessed night,</l>
<l>And them like <name>Mars</name> and <name>Ericine</name> displayd,</l>
<l>Both in each others armes chaind as they layd.</l>
<l>Againe she knew not how to frame her looke,</l>
<l>Or speake to him who in a moment tooke,</l>
<l>That which so long so charily she kept,</l>
<l>And fame by stealth away she would have crept,</l>
<l>And to some corner secretly have gone,</l>
<l>Leaving <name>Leander</name> in the bed alone.</l>
<l>But as her naked feet were whipping out,</l>
<l>He on the suddaine cling'd her so about,</l>
<l>That Meremaid-like unto the floore she slid,</l>
<l>One halfe appear'd, the other halfe was hid.</l>
<l>Thus neere the bed she blushing stood upright,</l>
<l>And from her countenance behold ye might,</l>
<l>A kind of twilight breake, which through the heare,</l>
<l>As from an orient cloud, glymse here and there.</l>
<l>And round about the chamber this false morne,</l>
<l>Brought foorth the day before the day was borne.</l>
<l>So <name>Heroes</name> ruddie cheeke, <name>Hero</name> betrayd,</l>
<l>And her all naked to his sight displayd.</l>
<l>Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure tooke,</l>
<l>Than <name>Dis</name>, on heapes of gold fixing his looke.</l>
<l>By this <name>Apollos</name> golden harpe began,</l>
<l>To sound foorth musicke to the <name>Ocean</name>,</l>
<l>Which watchfull <name>Hesperus</name> no sooner heard,</l>
<l>But he the days bright-bearing Car prepar'd.</l>
<l>And ran before, as Harbenger of light,</l>
<l>And with his flaring beames mockt ougly night,</l>
<l>Till she o'recome with anguish, shame, and rage,</l>
<l>Dang'd downe to hell her loathsome carriage.</l>

<p><lb/>I present your Ladiship with the last affections of the first two 
<lb/>Lovers that ever <name>Muse</name> shrinde in the Temple of <name>Memorie</name>; being drawne 
<lb/>by strange instigation to employ some of my serious time inso trifeling 
<lb/>a subject, which yet made the first Author, divine <name>Musaeus</name>, eternall. <lb/>And were it not that wee must subject our accounts of these common <lb/>received conceits to servile custome; it goes much against my hand to 
<lb/>signe that for a trifling subject, on which more worthines of soule hath 
<lb/>been shewed, and weight of divine wit, than can vouchsafe residence in 
<lb/>the leaden gravitie of any <name>Mony-Monger</name>; in whose profession all <lb/>serious subjects are concluded. But he that shuns trifles must shun the <lb/>world; out of whose reverend heapes of substance and austeritie, I can, 
<lb/>and will, ere long, single, or tumble out as brainles and passionate 
<lb/>fooleries, as ever panted in the bosome of the most ridiculous Lover. 
<lb/>Accept it therfore (good Madam) though as a trifle, yet as a serious 
<lb/>argument of my affection: for to bee thought thankefull for all free and <lb/>honourable favours, is a great summe of that riches my whole thrift
<lb/>intendeth.</p>
<p><lb/>Such uncourtly and sillie dispositions as mine, whose contentment 
<lb/>hath other objects than profit or glorie; are as glad, simply for the

<p><lb/>It hath therefore adjoynde much contentment to my desire of your

<lb/>this most sweet inclination, that flowes from the truth and eternitie of <lb/>Nobles; assure your Ladiship doth more suite your other Ornaments, 
<lb/>and makes more to the advancement of your Name, and happines of 
<lb/>your proceedings, then if(like others) you displaied Ensignes of state 
<lb/>and sowrenes in your forehead; made smooth with nothing but sensualitie
<lb/>and presents.</p>
<p><lb/>This poore Dedication (in figure of the other unitie betwixt Sir <lb/><name>Thomas</name>and your selfe) hath rejoynd you with him, my honoured best 
<lb/>friend, whose continuance of ancient kindnes to my still-obscured 
<lb/>estate, though it cannot encrease my love to him, which hath ever been <lb/>entirely circulare; yet shall it encourage my deserts to their utmost <lb/>requitall, and make my hartie gratitude speake; to which the

<lg><l>New light gives new directions, Fortunes new</l>
<l>To fashion our indevours that ensue,</l>
<l>More harsh (at lest more hard) more grave and hie</l>
<l>Our subject runs, and our sterne <name>Muse</name> must flie.</l>
<l>Loves edge is taken off, and that light flame,</l>
<l>Those thoughts, joyes, longings, that before became</l>
<l>High unexperienst blood, and maids sharpe plights,</l>
<l>Must now grow staid, and censure the delights,</l>
<l>That being enjoyd aske judgement; now we praise,</l>
<l>As having parted: Evenings crowne the daies.</l>

<l>Ye lisping Flatteries, and obsequious Glances,</l>
<l>Relentfull Musicks, and attractive Dances,</l>

<l>Shun loves stolne sports by that these Lovers prove.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>By this the Soveraigne of Heavens golden fires,</l>
<l>And yong <name>Leander</name>, Lord of his desires,</l>
<l>Together from their lovers armes arose:</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> into <name>Hellespontus</name> throwes</l>
<l>His Hero-handled bodie, whose delight</l>
<l>Made him disdaine each other Epethite.</l>

<l>That this word guilt, including double sence,</l>

<l>Might be exprest, that had no stay t'employ</l>
<l>The treasure which the Love-god let him joy</l>
<l>In his deare <name>Hero</name>, with such sacred thrift,</l>
<l>As had beseemd so sanctified a gift:</l>
<l>But like a greedie vulgar Prodigall</l>
<l>Would on the stock dispend, and rudely fall</l>
<l>Before his time, to that unblessed blessing,</l>

<l><quote n="proverb">Joy graven in sence, like snow in water wasts;</quote></l>

<l>With damaske eyes, the rubie blood doth peep,</l>

<l>Whose both hands limit both Loves deities,</l>

<l>Whose disposition silken is and kinde,</l>

<l>Who thinks not heaven with such a love is given?</l>
<l>And who like earth would spend that dower of heaven,</l>
<l>With ranke desire to joy it all at first?</l>
<l>What simply kils our hunger, quencheth thirst,</l>
<l>Clothes but our nakednes, and makes us live,</l>
<l><name>Praise</name> doth not any of her favours give:</l>

</lg>
<lg><l>Yet did the gentle flood transfer once more,</l>
<l>This prize of Love home to his fathers shore;</l>
<l>Where he unlades himselfe of that false welth</l>
<l>That makes few rich; treasures composde by stelth;</l>
<l>And to his sister kinde <name>Hermione</name>,</l>
<l>(Who on the shore kneeld, praying to the sea</l>
<l>For his returne) he all Loves goods did show</l>
<l>In <name>Hero</name> seasde for him, in him for <name>Hero</name>.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>His most kinde sister all his secrets knew,</l>
<l>And to her singing like a shower he flew,</l>
<l>Sprinkling the earth, that to their tombs tooke in</l>
<l>Streames dead for love to leave his ivorie skin,</l>
<l>Which yet a snowie fome did leave above,</l>
<l>As soule to the dead water that did love;</l>
<l>And from thence did the first white Roses spring,</l>
<l>(For love is sweet and faire in every thing)</l>
<l>And all the sweetned shore as he did goe,</l>
<l>Was crownd with odrous roses white as snow.</l>
<l>Love-blest <name>Leander</name> was with love so filled,</l>
<l>That love to all that toucht him he instilled.</l>
<l>And as the colours of all things we see,</l>
<l>To our sights powers communicated bee:</l>
<l>So to all objects that in compasse came</l>
<l>of any sence he had, his sences flame</l>
<l>Flowd from his parts, with force so virtuall,</l>
<l>It fir'd with sence things meere insensuall.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Now (with warme baths and odours comforted)</l>
<l>When he lay downe he kindly kist his bed,</l>
<l>As consecrating it to <name>Heros</name> right,</l>
<l>And vowd thereafter that what ever sight</l>
<l>Put him in minde of <name>Hero</name>, or her blisse,</l>
<l>Should be her Altar to prefer a kisse.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Then laid he forth his late inriched armes,</l>
<l>In whose white circle Love writ all his charmes,</l>
<l>And made his characters sweet <name>Heros</name> lims,</l>
<l>When on his breasts warme sea she sideling swims.</l>
<l>And as those armes (held up in circle) met,</l>
<l>He said; see sister, <name>Heros</name> Carquenet,</l>
<l>Which she had rather weare about her neck,</l>
<l>Then all the jewels that dot <name>Juno</name> deck.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>But as he shooke with passionate desire,</l>
<l>To put in flame his other secret fire,</l>
<l>A musick so divine did pierce his eare,</l>
<l>As never yet his ravisht sence did heare:</l>
<l>When suddenly a light of twentie hews</l>
<l>Brake through the roofe, and like the Rainbow views</l>
<l>Amazd <name>Leander</name>; in whose beames came downe</l>
<l>The Goddesse <name>Ceremonie</name>, with a Crowne</l>
<l>Of all the stars, and heaven with her descended.</l>
<l>Her flaming haire to her bright feete extended,</l>
<l>By which hung all the bench of Deities;</l>
<l>And in a chaine, compact of eares and eies,</l>
<l>She led Religion; all her bodie was</l>
<l>Cleere and transparent as the purest glasse:</l>
<l>For she was all presented to the sence;</l>
<l>Devotion, Order, State, and Reverence,</l>
<l>Her shadowes were; Societie, Memorie;</l>
<l>All which her sight made live, her absence die.</l>
<l>A rich disparent Pentackle she weares,</l>
<l>Drawne full of circles and strange characters:</l>
<l>Her face was changeable to everie eie;</l>
<l>One way lookt ill, another graciouslie;</l>
<l>Which while men viewd, they cheerfull were and holy:</l>
<l>But looking off, vicious, and melancholy:</l>
<l>The snakie paths to each observed law,</l>
<l>Did <name>Policie</name> in her broad bosome draw:</l>
<l>One hand a Mathematique Christall swayes,</l>
<l>Which gathering in one line a thousand rayes</l>
<l>From her bright eyes, <name>Confusion</name> burnes to death,</l>
<l>And all estates of men distinguisheth.</l>
<l>By it <name>Morallitie</name> and <name>Comelinesse</name>,</l>
<l>Themselves in all their sightly figures dresse.</l>
<l>Her other hand a lawrell rod applies,</l>
<l>To beate back <name>Barbarisme</name>, and <name>Avarice</name>,</l>
<l>That followd eating earth, and excrement</l>
<l>And humane lims; and would make proud ascent</l>
<l>To seates of Gods, were <name>Ceremonie</name> slaine;</l>
<l>The <name>Howrs</name> and <name>Graces</name> bore her glorious traine,</l>
<l>And all the sweetes of our societie</l>
<l>Were Spherde, and treasurde in her bountious eie.</l>
<l>Thus she appeard, and sharply did reprove</l>
<l><name>Leanders</name> bluntnes in his violent love;</l>
<l>Tolde him how poore was substance without rites,</l>
<l>Like bils unsignd; desires without delites;</l>
<l>Like meates unseasond; like ranke corne that growes</l>
<l>On Cottages, that none or reapes or sowes:</l>
<l>Not being with civill forms confirm'd and bounded,</l>
<l>For humane dignities and comforts founded:</l>
<l>But loose and secret all their glories hide,</l>
<l>Feare fils the chamber, darknes decks the Bride.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>She vanisht, leaving pierst <name>Leanders</name> hart</l>
<l>With sence of his unceremonious part,</l>
<l>In which with plaine neglect of Nuptiall rites,</l>
<l>He close and flatly fell to his delites:</l>
<l>And instantly he vowd to celebrate</l>
<l>All rites pertaining to his maried state.</l>
<l>So up he gets and to his father goes,</l>
<l>To whose glad eares he doth his vowes disclose:</l>
<l>The Nuptials are resolv'd with utmost powre,</l>

<l>To bring her covertly, where ships must stay,</l>
<l>Sent by his father throughly rigd and mand,</l>
<l>To waft her safely to <name>Abydus</name> Strand.</l>
<l>There leave we him, and with fresh wing pursue</l>
<l>Astonisht <name>Hero</name>, whose most wished view</l>
<l>I thus long have forborne, because I left her</l>
<l>So out of countuance, and her spirits bereft her.</l>

<l>Strange thoughts possest her, ransacking her brest</l>
<l>For that that was not there, her wonted rest.</l>
<l>She was a mother straight and bore with paine,</l>
<l>Thoughts that spake straight and wisht their mother slaine;</l>
<l>She hates their lives, and they their own and hers:</l>
<l>Such strife still growes where sin the race prefers.</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Love is a golden bubble full of dreames,</quote></l>
<l><quote n="proverb">That waking breakes, and fils us with extreames.</quote></l>
<l>She mus'd how she could looke upon her Sire,</l>
<l>And not shew that without, that was intire.</l>
<l>For as a glasse is an inanimate eie,</l>
<l>And outward formes imbraceth inwardlie:</l>
<l>So is the eye an animate glasse that showes</l>
<l>In-formes without us. And as <name>Phoebus</name> throwes</l>
<l>His beames abroad, though he in clowdes be closde,</l>
<l>Still glancing by them till he finde opposde,</l>
<l>A loose and rorid vapour that is fit</l>
<l>T'event his searching beames, and useth it</l>
<l>To forme a tender twentie-coloured eie,</l>
<l>Cast in a circle round about the skie.</l>
<l>So when our fine soule, Our bodies starre,</l>
<l>(That ever is in motion circulare)</l>
<l>Conceives a forme; in seeking to display it,</l>
<l>Through all Our clowdie parts, it doth convey it</l>
<l>Forth at the eye, as the most pregnant place,</l>
<l>And that reflects it round about the face.</l>
<l>And this event uncourtly <name>Hero</name> thought,</l>
<l>Her inward guilt would in her lookes have wrought:</l>
<l>For yet the worlds stale cunning she resisted</l>
<l>To beare foule thoughts, yet forge what lookes she listed,</l>
<l>And held it for a very sillie sleight,</l>
<l>To make a perfect mettall counterfeit:</l>
<l>Glad to disclaime her selfe; proud of an Art,</l>
<l>That makes the face a Pandar to the hart.</l>
<l>Those be the painted Moones, whose lights prophane</l>
<l>Beauties true Heaven, at full still in their wane.</l>
<l>Those be the Lapwing faces that still crie,</l>
<l>Here tis, when that they vow is nothing nie.</l>
<l>Base fooles, when every moorish fowle can teach</l>
<l>That which men thinke the height of humane reach.</l>
<l>But custome that the Apoplexie is</l>
<l>Of beddred nature and lives led amis,</l>
<l>And takes away all feeling of offence,</l>
<l>Yet brazde not <name>Heros</name> brow with impudence;</l>
<l>And this she thought most hard to bring to pas,</l>
<l>To seeme in counmance other then she was.</l>
<l>As if she had two soules; one for the face,</l>
<l>One for the hart; and that they shifted place</l>
<l>As either list to utter, or conceale</l>
<l>What they conceiv'd: or as one soule did deale</l>
<l>With both affayres at once, keeps and ejects</l>
<l>Both at an instant contrarie effects:</l>
<l>Retention and ejection in her powrs</l>
<l>Being acts alike: for this one vice of ours,</l>
<l>That forms the thought, and swaies the countenance,</l>
<l>Rules both our motion and our utterance.</l>
<l>These and more grave conceits toyld <name>Heros</name> spirits:</l>
<l>For though the light of her discoursive wits</l>
<l>Perhaps might finde some little hole to pas</l>
<l>Through all these worldly cinctures; yet (alas)</l>
<l>There was a heavenly flame incompast her;</l>
<l>Her Goddesse, in whose Phane she did prefer</l>
<l>Her virgin vowes; from whose impulsive sight</l>
<l>She knew the black shield of the darkest night</l>
<l>Could not defend her, nor wits subtilst art:</l>
<l>This was the point pierst <name>Hero</name> to the hart.</l>
<l>Who heavie to the death, with a deep sigh</l>
<l>And hand that languisht, tooke a robe was nigh,</l>
<l>Exceeding large, and of black Cypres made,</l>
<l>In which she sate, hid from the day in shade,</l>
<l>Even over head and face downe to her feete;</l>
<l>Her left hand made it at her bosome meete;</l>
<l>Her right hand leand on her hart-bowing knee,</l>
<l>Wrapt in unshapefull foulds twas death to see:</l>
<l>Her knee stayd that, and that her falling face,</l>
<l>Each limme helpt other to put on disgrace.</l>
<l>No forme was seene, where forme held all her sight:</l>
<l>But like an Embrion that saw never light:</l>
<l>Or like a scorched statue made a cole</l>
<l>With three-wingd lightning: or a wretched soule</l>
<l>Muffled with endles darknes, she did sit:</l>
<l>The night had never such a heavie spirit.</l>
<l>Yet might an imitating eye well see,</l>
<l>How fast her deere teares melted on her knee</l>
<l>Through her black vaile, and turnd as black as it,</l>
<l>Mourning to be her teares: then wrought her wit</l>
<l>With her broke vow, her Goddesse wrath, her fame,</l>
<l>All tooles that enginous despayre could frame:</l>
<l>Which made her strow the floore with her torne haire,</l>
<l>And spread her mantle peece-meale in the aire.</l>
<l>Like <name>Joves</name> sons club, strong passion strooke her downe,</l>
<l>And with a piteous shrieke inforst her swoune:</l>
<l>Her shrieke, made with another shrieke ascend</l>
<l>The frighted Matron that on her did tend:</l>
<l>And as with her owne crie her sence was slaine,</l>
<l>So with the other it was calde againe.</l>
<l>She rose and to her bed made forced way,</l>
<l>And layd her downe even where <name>Leander</name> lay:</l>
<l>And all this while the red sea of her blood</l>
<l>Ebd with <name>Leander</name>: but now turnd the flood,</l>
<l>And all her fleete of sprites came swelling in</l>
<l>With childe of saile, and did hot fight begin</l>
<l>With those severe conceits, she too much markt,</l>
<l>And here <name>Leanders</name> beauties were imbarkt.</l>
<l>He came in swimming painted all with joyes,</l>
<l>Such as might sweeten hell: his thought destroyes</l>
<l>All her destroying thoughts: she thought she felt</l>
<l>His heart in hers, with her contentions melt:</l>
<l>And chid her soule that it could so much erre,</l>
<l>To check the true joyes he deserv'd in her.</l>
<l>Her fresh heat blood cast figures in her eyes,</l>
<l>And she supposde she saw in <name>Neptunes</name> skyes</l>
<l>How her star wandred, washt in smarting brine</l>
<l>For her loves sake, that with immortall wine</l>
<l>Should be embat'd, and swim in more hearts ease,</l>
<l>Than there was water in the <name>Sestian</name> seas.</l>
<l>Then said her <name>Cupid</name> prompted spirit; shall I</l>
<l>Sing mones to such delightsome harmony?</l>
<l>Shall slick-tongde fame patcht up with voyces rude,</l>
<l>The drunken bastard of the multitude,</l>
<l>(Begot when father Judgement is away,</l>
<l>And gossip-like, sayes because others say,</l>
<l>Takes newes as if it were too hot to eate,</l>
<l>And spits it slavering forth for dog-fees meate)</l>
<l>Make me for forging a phantastique vow,</l>
<l>Presume to beare what makes grave matrons bow?</l>
<l>Good vowes are never broken with good deedes,</l>
<l>For then good deedes were bad: vowes are but seedes,</l>
<l>And good deeds fruits; even those good deedes that grow</l>
<l>From other stocks than from th'observed vow.</l>
<l>That is a good deede that prevents a bad:</l>
<l>Had I not yeelded, slaine my selfe I had.</l>
<l><name>Hero Leander</name> is, <name>Leander Hero</name>:</l>
<l>Such vertue love hath to make one of two.</l>
<l>If then <name>Leander</name> did my maydenhead git,</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> being my selfe I still retaine it.</l>
<l>We breake chast vowes when we live loosely ever:</l>
<l>But bound as we are, we live loosely never.</l>
<l>Two constant lovers being joynd in one,</l>
<l>Yeelding to one another, yeeld to none.</l>
<l>We know not how to vow, till love unblinde us,</l>
<l>And vowes made ignorantly never binde us.</l>
<l>Too true it is that when t'is gone men hate</l>
<l>The joyes as vaine they tooke in loves estate:</l>
<l>But that's, since they have lost the heavenly light</l>
<l>Should shew them way to judge of all things right.</l>
<l>When life is gone death must implant his terror,</l>
<l>As death is foe to life, so love to error.</l>
<l>Before we love how range we through this sphere,</l>
<l>Searching the sundrie fancies hunted here:</l>
<l>Now with desire of wealth transported quite</l>
<l>Beyond our free humanities delight:</l>
<l>Now with ambition climing falling towrs,</l>
<l>Whose hope to scale our feare to fall devours:</l>
<l>Now rapt with pastimes, pomp, all joyes impure;</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">In things without us no delight is sure.</quote></l>
<l>But love with all joyes crownd, within doth sit;</l>
<l>O Goddesse pitie love and pardon it.</l>
<l>This spake she weeping: but her Goddesse eare</l>
<l>Burnd with too sterne a heat, and would not heare.</l>
<l>Aie me, hath heavens straight fingers no more graces</l>
<l>For such as <name>Hero</name>, then for homeliest faces?</l>
<l>Yet she hopte well, and in her sweet conceit</l>
<l>Waying her arguments, she thought them weight:</l>
<l>And that the logick of <name>Leanders</name> beautie,</l>
<l>And them together would bring proofes of dutie.</l>
<l>And if her soule, that was a skilfull glance</l>
<l>Of Heavens great essence, found such imperance</l>
<l>In her loves beauties; she had confidence</l>
<l><name>Jove</name> lov'd him too, and pardond her offence.</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Beautie in heaven and earth this grace doth win,</quote></l>
<l><quote n="proverb">It supples rigor, and it lessens sin.</quote></l>
<l>Thus, her sharpe wit, her love, her secrecie,</l>
<l>Trouping together, made her wonder why</l>
<l>She should not leave her bed, and to the Temple?</l>
<l>Her health sayd she must live; her sex, dissemble.</l>
<l>She viewd <name>Leanders</name> place, and wisht he were</l>
<l>Turnd to his place, so his place were <name>Leander</name>.</l>
<l>Aye me (sayd she) that loves sweet life and sence</l>
<l>Should doe it harme! my love had not gone hence,</l>
<l>Had he been like his place. O blessed place,</l>
<l>Image of Constancie. Thus my loves grace</l>
<l>Parts no where but it leaves some thing behinde</l>
<l>Worth observation: he renowmes his kinde.</l>
<l>His motion is like heavens Orbiculer:</l>
<l>For where he once is, he is ever there.</l>
<l>This place was mine: <name>Leander</name> now t'is thine;</l>
<l>Thou being my selfe, then it is double mine:</l>
<l>Mine, and <name>Leanders</name> mine, <name>Leanders</name> mine.</l>
<l>O see what wealth it yeelds me, nay yeelds him:</l>
<l>For I am in it, he for me doth swim.</l>
<l>Rich, fruitfull love, that doubling selfe estates</l>
<l><name>Elixer-</name> likecontracts, though separates.</l>

<l><name>Hero</name>, in sacred habit deckt,</l>
<l>Doth private sacrifice effect.</l>
<l>Her Skarfs description wrought byfate,</l>
<l><name>Ostents</name>, that threaten her estate.</l>
<l>The strange, yet Phisicall events,</l>

<l>In thunder, <name>Ciprides</name> descends,</l>

<l><name>Venus</name>, to wreake her rites abuses,</l>
<l>Creates the monster <name>Eronusis</name>;</l>
<l>Enflaming <name>Heros</name> Sacrifice,</l>
<l>With lightning darted from her eyes:</l>
<l>And thereof springs the painted beast,</l>
<l>That ever since taints every breast.</l></argument>

<lg><l>Now from <name>Leanders</name> place she rose, and found</l>
<l>Her haire and rent robe scattred on the ground:</l>
<l>Which taking up, she every peece did lay</l>
<l>Upon an Altar; where in youth of day</l>
<l>She usde t'exhibite private Sacrifice:</l>
<l>Those would she offer to the Deities</l>
<l>Of her faire Goddesse, and her powerfull son,</l>
<l>As relicks of her late-felt passion:</l>
<l>And in that holy sort she vowd to end them,</l>
<l>In hope her violent fancies that did rend them,</l>
<l>Would as quite fade in her loves holy fire,</l>
<l>As they should in the flames she ment t'inspire.</l>
<l>Then put she on all her religious weedes,</l>
<l>That deckt her in her secret sacred deedes:</l>
<l>A crowne of Isickles, that sunne nor fire</l>
<l>Could ever melt, and figur'd chast desire.</l>
<l>A golden star shinde in her naked breast,</l>
<l>In honour of the Queene-light of the East.</l>
<l>In her right hand she held a silver wand,</l>
<l>On whose bright top <name>Peristera</name> did stand,</l>
<l>Who was a Nymph, but now transformd a Dove,</l>
<l>And in her life was deare in <name>Venus</name> love:</l>
<l>And for her sake she ever since that time,</l>
<l>Chusde Doves to draw her Coach through heavens blew clime.</l>
<l>Her plentious haire in curled billowes swims</l>
<l>On her bright shoulder: her harmonious lims</l>
<l>Sustainde no more but a most subtile vaile</l>
<l>That hung on them, as it durst not assaile</l>
<l>Their different concord: for the weakest ayre</l>
<l>Could raise it swelling from her bewties fayre:</l>
<l>Nor did it cover, but adumbrate onelie</l>
<l>Her most heart-piercing parts, that a blest eie</l>
<l>Might see (as it did shadow) fearfullie,</l>
<l>All that all-love-deserving Paradise:</l>
<l>It was as blew as the most freezing skies,</l>
<l>Neere the Seas hew, for thence her Goddesse came:</l>
<l>On it a skarfe she wore of wondrous frame;</l>
<l>In midst whereof she wrought a virgins face,</l>
<l>From whose each cheeke a fine blush did chace</l>
<l>Two crimson flames, that did two waies extend,</l>
<l>Spreading the ample skarfe to either end,</l>
<l>Which figur'd the division of her minde,</l>
<l>Whiles yet she rested bashfully inclinde,</l>
<l>And stood not resolute to wed <name>Leander</name>.</l>
<l>This serv'd her white neck for a purple sphere,</l>
<l>And cast it selfe at full breadth downe her back.</l>
<l>There (since the first breath that begun the wrack</l>
<l>of her free quiet from <name>Leanders</name> lips)</l>
<l>She wrought a Sea in one flame full of ships:</l>
<l>But that one ship where all her wealth did passe</l>
<l>(Like simple marchants goods) <name>Leander</name> was:</l>
<l>For in that Sea she naked figured him;</l>
<l>Her diving needle taught him how to swim,</l>
<l>And to each thred did such resemblance give,</l>
<l>For joy to be so like him, it did live.</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Things senceles live by art, and rationall die,</quote></l>
<l><quote n="proverb">By rude contempt of art and industrie.</quote></l>
<l>Scarce could she work, but in her strength of thought</l>
<l>She feard she prickt <name>Leander</name> as she wrought:</l>
<l>And oft would shrieke so, that her Guardian frighted,</l>
<l>Would staring haste, as with some mischiefe cited.</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">They double life that dead things griefs sustayne:</quote></l>
<l><quote n="proverb">They kill that feele not their friends living payne.</quote></l>
<l>Sometimes she feard he sought her infamie,</l>
<l>And then as she was working of his eie,</l>
<l>She thought to pricke it out to quench her ill:</l>
<l>But as she prickt, it grew more perfect still.</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Trifling attempts no serious acts advance;</quote></l>
<l><quote n="proverb">The fire of love is blowne by dalliance.</quote></l>
<l>In working his fayre neck she did so grace it,</l>
<l>She still was working her owne armes t'imbrace it:</l>
<l>That, and his shoulders, and his hands were seene</l>
<l>Above the streame, and with a pure Sea greene</l>
<l>She did so queintly shadow every lim,</l>
<l>All might be seene beneath the waves to swim. </l>
</lg>
<lg><l>In this conceited skarfe she wrought beside</l>
<l>A Moone in change, and shooting stars did glide</l>
<l>In number after her with bloodie beames,</l>
<l>Which figur'd her affects in their extreames,</l>
<l>Pursiung Nature in her <name>Cynthian</name> bodie,</l>
<l>And did her thoughts running on change implie:</l>
<l>For maids take more delights when they prepare</l>
<l>And thinke of wives states, than when wives they are.</l>
<l>Beneath all these she wrought a Fisherman,</l>
<l>Drawing his nets from forth that Ocean;</l>
<l>Who drew so hard ye might discover well,</l>
<l>The toughned sinewes in his neck did swell:</l>
<l>His inward straines drave out his blood-shot eyes,</l>
<l>And springs of sweat did in his forehead rise:</l>
<l>Yet was of nought but of a Serpent sped,</l>
<l>That in his bosome flew and stung him dead.</l>
<l>And this by fate into her minde was sent,</l>
<l>Not wrought by meere instinct of her intent.</l>
<l>At the skarfs other end her hand did frame,</l>
<l>Neere the forkt point of the devided flame,</l>
<l>A countrie virgin keeping of a Vine,</l>
<l>Who did of hollow bulrushes combine</l>
<l>Snares for the stubble-loving Grashopper,</l>
<l>And by her lay her skrip that nourisht her.</l>
<l>Within a myrtle shade she sate and sung,</l>
<l>And tufts of waving reedes about her sprung:</l>
<l>Where lurkt two Foxes, that while she applide</l>
<l>Her trifling snares, their theeveries did devide:</l>
<l>One to the vine, another to her skrip,</l>
<l>That she did negligently overslip:</l>
<l>By which her fruitfull vine and holesome fare,</l>
<l>She suffred spoyld to make a childish snare.</l>
<l>These omenous fancies did her soule expresse,</l>
<l>And every finger made a Prophetesse,</l>
<l>To shew what death was hid in loves disguise,</l>
<l>And make her judgement conquer destinies.</l>
<l>O what sweet formes fayre Ladies soules doe shrowd,</l>
<l>Were they made seene and forced through their blood,</l>
<l>If through their beauties like rich work through lawn,</l>
<l>They would set forth their minds with vertues drawn,</l>
<l>In letting graces from their fingers flie,</l>
<l>To still their yas thoughts with industrie:</l>
<l>That their plied wits in numbred silks might sing</l>
<l>Passions huge conquest, and their needels leading</l>
<l>Affection prisoner through their own-built citties,</l>
<l>Pinniond with stories and <name>Arachnean</name> ditties.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Proceed we now with <name>Heros</name> sacrifice;</l>
<l>She odours burnd, and from their smoke did rise</l> 
<l>Unsavorie fumes, that ayre with plagues inspired,</l>
<l>And then the consecrated sticks she fired.</l>
<l>On whose pale flame an angrie spirit flew,</l>
<l>And beate it downe still as it upward grew.</l>
<l>The virgin Tapers that on th'altar stood,</l>
<l>When she inflam'd them burnd as red as blood:</l>
<l>All sad ostents of that too neere successe,</l>
<l>That made such moving beauties motionlesse.</l>
<l>Then <name>Hero</name> wept; but her affrighted eyes</l>
<l>She quickly wrested from the sacrifice:</l>
<l>Shut them, and inwards for <name>Leander</name> lookt,</l>
<l>Searcht her soft bosome, and from thence she pluckt</l>
<l>His lovely picture: which when she had viewd,</l>
<l>Her beauties were with all loves joyes renewd.</l>
<l>The odors sweetned, and the fires burnd deere,</l>
<l><name>Leanders</name> forme left no ill object there.</l>
<l>Such was his beautie that the force of light,</l>
<l>Whose knowledge teacheth wonders infinite,</l>
<l>The strength of number and proportion,</l>
<l>Nature had plaste in it to make it knowne</l>
<l>Art was her daughter, and what humane wits</l>
<l>For studie lost, intombd in drossie spirits.</l>
<l>After this accident (which for her glorie</l>
<l><name>Hero</name> could not but make a historie)</l>
<l>Th'inhabitants of <name>Sestus</name>, and <name>Abydus</name>,</l>
<l>Did every yeare with feasts propitious,</l>
<l>To faire <name>Leanders</name> picture sacrifice,</l>
<l>And they were persons of especiall prize</l>
<l>That were allowd it, as an Ornament</l>
<l>T'inrich their houses; for the continent</l>
<l>of the strange vertues all approv'd it held:</l>
<l>For even the very looke of it repeld</l>
<l>All blastings, witchcrafts, and the strifes of nature</l>
<l>In those diseases that no hearbs could cure.</l>
<l>The woolfie sting of Avarice it would pull,</l>
<l>And make the rankest miser bountifull.</l>
<l>It kild the feare of thunder and of death;</l>
<l>The discords that conceits ingendereth</l>
<l>Twixt man and wife, it for the time would cease:</l>
<l>The flames of love it quencht, and would increase:</l>
<l>Held in a princes hand it would put out</l>
<l>The dreadfulst Comet: it would ease all doubt</l>
<l>of threatned mischiefes: it would bring asleepe</l>
<l>Such as were mad: it would enforce to weepe</l>
<l>Most barbarous eyes: and many more effects</l>
<l>This picture wrought, and sprung <name>Leandrian</name> sects,</l>
<l>Of which was <name>Hero</name> first: For he whose forme</l>
<l>(Held in her hand) cleerd such a fatall storme,</l>
<l>From hell she thought his person would defend her,</l>
<l>Which night and <name>Hellespont</name> would quickly send her.</l>
<l>With this confirmd, she vowd to banish quite</l>
<l>All thought of any check to her delite:</l>
<l>And in contempt of sillie bashfulnes,</l>
<l>She would the faith of her desires professe:</l>
<l>Where her Religion should be Policie,</l>
<l>To follow love with zeale her pietie:</l>
<l>Her chamber her Cathedrall Church should be,</l>
<l>And her <name>Leander</name> her chiefe Deitie.</l>
<l>For in her love these did the gods forego;</l>
<l>And though her knowledge did not teach her so,</l>
<l>Yet did it teach her this, that what her hart</l>
<l>Did greatest hold in her selfe greatest part,</l>
<l>That she did make her god; and t'was lesse nought</l>
<l>To leave gods in profession and in thought,</l>
<l>Than in her love and life: for therein lies</l>
<l>Most of her duties, and their dignities.</l>
<l>And raile the brain-bald world at what it will;</l>
<l>Thats the grand Atheisme that raignes in it still.</l>
<l>Yet singularitie she would use no more,</l>
<l>For she was singular too much before:</l>
<l>But she would please the world with fayre pretext;</l>
<l>Love would not leave her conscience perplext.</l>
<l>Great men that will have lesse doe for them, still</l>
<l>Must beare them out though th'acts be nere so ill.</l>
<l>Meannes must Pandar be to Excellence,</l>
<l>Pleasure attones Falshood and Conscience:</l>
<l>Dissembling was the worst (thought <name>Hero</name> then)</l>
<l>And that was best now she must live with men.</l>
<l>O vertuous love that taught her to doe best,</l>
<l>When she did worst, and when she thought it lest.</l>
<l>Thus would she still proceed in works divine,</l>
<l>And in her sacred state of priesthood shine,</l>
<l>Handling the holy rites with hands as bold,</l>
<l>As if therein she did <name>Joves</name> thunder hold;</l>
<l>And need not feare those menaces of error,</l>
<l>Which she at others threw with greatest terror.</l>
<l>O lovely <name>Hero</name>, nothing is thy sin,</l>
<l>Wayd with those foule faults other Priests are in;</l>
<l>That having neither faiths, nor works, nor bewties,</l>
<l>T'engender any scuse for slubberd duties;</l>
<l>With as much countnance fill their holie chayres,</l>
<l>And sweat denouncements gainst prophane affayres,</l>
<l>As if their lives were cut out by their places,</l>
<l>And they the only fathers of the Graces.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Now as with setled minde she did repaire,</l>
<l>Her thoughts to sacrifice her ravisht haire,</l>
<l>And her torne robe which on the altar lay,</l>
<l>And only for Religions fire did stay;</l>
<l>She heard a thunder by the Cyclops beaten,</l>
<l>In such a volley as the world did threaten,</l>
<l>Given <name>Venus</name> as she parted th'ayrie Sphere,</l>
<l>Discending now to chide with <name>Hero</name> here:</l>
<l>When suddenly the Goddesse waggoners,</l>
<l>The Swans and Turtles that in coupled pheres,</l>
<l>Through all worlds bosoms draw her influence,</l>
<l>Lighted in <name>Heros</name> window, and from thence</l>
<l>To her fayre shoulders flew the gentle Doves,</l>
<l>Gracefull <name>Aedone</name> that sweet pleasure loves,</l>
<l>And ruffoot <name>Chreste</name> with the tufted crowne,</l>
<l>Both which did kisse her, though their Goddes frowne.</l>
<l>The Swans did in the solid flood, her glasse,</l>
<l>Proyne their fayre plumes; of which the fairest was</l>
<l><name>Jove-</name> lov'd <name>Leucote</name>, thatpure brightnes is;</l>
<l>The other bountie-loving <name>Dapsilis</name>.</l>
<l>All were in heaven, now they with <name>Hero</name> were:</l>
<l>But <name>Venus</name>  lookes brought wrath, and urged feare.</l>
<l>Her robe was skarlet, black her heads attire,</l>
<l>And through her naked breast shinde streames of fire,</l>
<l>As when the rarefied ayre is driven</l>
<l>In flashing streames, and opes the darkned heaven.</l>
<l>In her white hand a wreath of yew she bore,</l>
<l>And breaking th'icie wreath sweet <name>Hero</name> wore,</l>
<l>She forst about her browes her wreath of yew,</l>
<l>And sayd; now minion to thy fate be trew,</l>
<l>Though not to me, indure what this portends;</l>
<l>Begin where lightnes will, in shame it ends.</l>
<l>Love makes thee cunning; thou art currant now,</l>
<l>By being counterfeit: thy broken vow,</l>
<l>Deceit with her pide garters must rejoyne,</l>
<l>And with her stampe thou countnances must coyne,</l>
<l>Coynes, and pure deceits for purities:</l>
<l>And still a mayd wilt seeme in cosoned eies,</l>
<l>And have an antike face to laugh within,</l>
<l>While thy smooth lookes make men digest thy sin.</l>
<l>But since thy lips (lest thought forsworne) forswore,</l>
<l>Be never virgins vow worth trusting more.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>When Beauties dearest did her Goddesse heare</l>
<l>Breathe such rebukes gainst that she could not cleare;</l>
<l>Dumbe sorrow spake alowd in teares, and blood</l>
<l>That from her griefe-burst vaines in piteous flood,</l>
<l>From the sweet conduits of her favor fell:</l>
<l>The gentle Turtles did with moanes make swell</l>
<l>Their shining gorges: the white black-eyde Swans</l>
<l>Did sing as woflill Epicedians,</l>
<l>As they would straightwaies dye: when pities Queene</l>
<l>The Goddesse <name>Ecte</name>, that had ever beene</l>
<l>Hid in a watrie clowde neere <name>Heros</name> cries,</l>
<l>Since the first instant of her broken eies,</l>
<l>Gave bright <name>Leucote</name> voyce, and made her speake,</l>
<l>To ease her anguish, whose swolne breast did breake</l>
<l>With anger at her Goddesse, that did touch</l>
<l><name>Hero</name> so neere for that she usde so much.</l>
<l>And thrusting her white neck at <name>Venus</name>, sayd;</l>
<l>Why may not amorous <name>Hero</name> seeme a mayd,</l>
<l>Though she be none, as well as you suppresse</l>
<l>In modest cheekes your inward wantonnesse?</l>
<l>How often have wee drawne you from above,</l>
<l>T'exchange with mortals, rites for rites in love?</l>
<l>Why in your preist then call you that offence</l>
<l>That shines in you, and is your influence?</l>
<l>With this the furies stopt <name>Leucotes</name> lips,</l>
<l>Enjoynd by <name>Venus</name>; who with Rosie whips</l>
<l>Beate the kind Bird. Fierce lightning from her eyes</l>
<l>Did set on fire faire <name>Heros</name> sacrifice,</l>
<l>Which was her torne robe, and inforced hayre;</l>
<l>And the bright flame became a mayd most faire</l>
<l>For her aspect: her tresses were of wire,</l>
<l>Knit like a net, where harts all set on fire,</l>
<l>Strugled in pants and could not get releast:</l>
<l>Her armes were all with golden pincers drest,</l>
<l>And twentie fashiond knots, pullies, and brakes,</l>
<l>And all her bodie girdled with painted Snakes.</l>
<l>Her doune parts in a Scorpions taile combinde,</l>
<l>Freckled with twentie colours; pyed wings shinde</l>
<l>Out of her shoulders; Cloth had never die,</l>
<l>Nor sweeter colours never viewed eie,</l>
<l>In scorching <name>Turkie</name>, <name>Cares</name>, <name>Tartarie</name>,</l>
<l>Than shinde about this spirit notorious;</l>
<l>Nor was <name>Arachnes</name> web so glorious.</l>
<l>Of lightning and of shreds she was begot;</l>
<l>More hold in base dissemblers is there not.</l>
<l>Her name was <name>Eronusis</name>. <name>Venus</name> flew</l>
<l>From <name>Heros</name> sight, and at her Chariot drew</l>
<l>This wondrous creature to so steepe a height,</l>
<l>That all the world she might command with sleight</l>
<l>of her gay wings: and then she bad her hast,</l>
<l>Since <name>Hero</name> had dissembled, and disgrast</l>
<l>Her rites so much, and every breast infect</l>
<l>With her deceits; she made her Architect</l>
<l>Of all dissimulation, and since then</l>
<l>Never was any trust in maides nor men.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>O it spighted,</l>
<l>Fayre <name>Venus</name> hart to see her most delighted,</l>
<l>And one she chusde for temper of her minde,</l>
<l>To be the only ruler of her kinde,</l>
<l>So soone to let her virgin race be ended:</l>
<l>Not simply for the fault a whit offended;</l>
<l>But that in strife for chastnes with the Moone,</l>
<l>Spitefull <name>Diana</name> bad her shew but one,</l>
<l>That was her servant vowd, and liv'd a mayd,</l>
<l>And now she thought to answer that upbrayd,</l>
<l><name>Hero</name> had lost her answer; who knowes not</l>
<l><name>Venus</name> would seeme as farre from any spot</l>
<l>Of light demeanour, as the very skin</l>
<l>Twixt <name>Cynthias</name> browes; Sin is asham'd of Sin.</l>
<l>Up <name>Venus</name> flew, and scarce durst up for feare</l>
<l>Of <name>Phoebes</name> laughter, when she past her Sphere:</l>
<l>And so most ugly clowded was the light,</l>
<l>That day was hid in day; night came ere night,</l>
<l>And <name>Venus</name> could not through the thick ayre pierce,</l>
<l>Till the dales king, god of undanted verse,</l>
<l>Because she was so plentifull a theame,</l>
<l>To such as wore his Lawrell <name>Anademe</name>:</l>
<l>Like to a fine bullet made descent,</l>
<l>And from her passage those fat vapours rent,</l>
<l>That being not throughly rarefide to raine,</l>
<l>Melted like pitch as blew as any vaine,</l>
<l>And scalding tempests made the earth to shrinke</l>
<l>Under their fervor, and the world did thinke</l>
<l>In every drop a torturing Spirit flew,</l>
<l>It pierst so deeply, and it burnd so blew.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Betwixt all this and <name>Hero</name>, <name>Hero</name> held</l>
<l><name>Leanders</name> picture as a <name>Persean</name> shield:</l>
<l>And she was free from feare of worst successe;</l>
<l>The more ill threats us, we suspect the lesse;</l>
<l>As we grow haples, violence subtle growes,</l>
<l>Dumb, deafe, and	blind, and comes when no man knowes.</l>

<argument><head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE FIFT SESTYAD.</head>
<l>Day doubles her accustomd date,</l>
<l>As loth the night, incenst by fate,</l>
<l>Should wrack our lovers; <name>Heros</name> plight,</l>
<l>Longs for <name>Leander</name>, and the night:</l>
<l>Which, ere her thirstie wish recovers,</l>
<l>She sends for two betrothed lovers,</l>
<l>And marries them, that (with their crew,</l>
<l>Their sports and ceremonies due)</l>
<l>She covertly might celebrate,</l>
<l>With secret joy her owne estate.</l>
<l>She makes a feast, at which appeares</l>
<l>The wilde Nymph <name>Teras</name>, that still beares</l>
<l>An Ivory Lute, tels Omenous tales,</l>
<l>And sings at solemne festivales.</l></argument>

<lg><l>Now was bright <name>Hero</name> weary of the day,</l>
<l>Thought an Olympiad in <name>Leanders</name> stay.</l>
<l><name>Sol</name>  and the soft-foote <name>Howrs</name> hung on his armes,</l>
<l>And would not let him swim, foreseeing his harmes:</l>
<l>That day <name>Aurora</name> double grace obtainde</l>
<l>Of her love <name>Phoebus</name>; she his Horses rainde,</l>
<l>Set on his golden knee, and as she list</l>
<l>She puld him back; and as she puld, she kist</l>
<l>To have him turne to bed; he lov'd her more,</l>
<l>To see the love <name>Leander Hero</name> bore.</l>
<l>Examples profit much: ten times in one,</l>
<l>In persons full of note, good deedes are done.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Day was so long, men walking fell asleepe,</l>
<l>The heavie humors that their eyes did steepe,</l>
<l>Made them feare mischiefs. The hard streets were beds</l>
<l>For covetous churles, and for ambitious heads,</l>
<l>That spight of Nature would their busines plie.</l>
<l>All thought they had the falling <name>Epilepsie</name>,</l>
<l>Men groveld so upon the smotherd ground,</l>
<l>And pittie did the hart of heaven confound.</l>
<l>The Gods, the Graces, and the Muses came</l>
<l>Downe to the Destinies, to stay the frame</l>
<l>Of the true lovers deaths, and all worlds teares:</l>
<l>But death before had stopt their cruell eares.</l>
<l>All the Celestials parted mourning then,</l>
<l>Pierst with our humane miseries more then men.</l>
<l>Ah, nothing doth the world with mischiefe fill,</l>
<l>But want of feeling one anothers ill.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>With their descent the day grew something fayre,</l>
<l>And cast a brighter robe upon the ayre.</l>
<l><name>Hero</name> to shorten time with merriment,</l>
<l>For yong <name>Alcmane</name>, and bright <name>Mya</name> sent,</l>
<l>Two lovers that had long crav'd mariage dues</l>
<l>At <name>Heros</name> hands: but she did still refuse,</l>
<l>For lovely <name>Mya</name> was her consort vowd</l>
<l>In her maids state, and therefore not allowd</l>
<l>To amorous Nuptials: yet faire <name>Hero</name> now</l>
<l>Intended to dispence with her cold vow,</l>
<l>Since hers was broken, and to marrie her:</l>
<l>The rites would pleasing matter minister</l>
<l>To her conceits, and shorten tedious day.</l>
<l>They came; sweet Musick usherd th'odorous way,</l>
<l>And wanton Ayre in twentie sweet forms danst</l>
<l>After her fingers; Beautie and Love advanst</l>
<l>Their ensignes in the downles rosie faces</l>
<l>Of youths and maids, led after by the Graces.</l>
<l>For all these, <name>Hero</name> made a friendly feast,</l>
<l>Welcomd them kindly, did much love protest,</l>
<l>Winning their harts with all the meanes she might,</l>
<l>That when her fault should chance t'abide the light,</l>
<l>Their loves might cover or extenuate it,</l>
<l>And high in her worst fate make pittie sit.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>She married them, and in the banquet came</l>
<l>Borne by the virgins: <name>Hero</name> striv'd to frame</l>
<l>Her thoughts to mirth. Aye me, but hard it is</l>
<l>To imitate a false and forced blis.</l>
<l>Ill may a sad minde forge a merrie face,</l>
<l>Nor hath constrained laughter any grace.</l>
<l>Then layd she wine on cares to make them sinke;</l>

<l>A Nymph that haunted the greene <name>Sestyan</name> groves,</l>
<l>And would consort soft virgins in their loves,</l>
<l>At gaysome Triumphs, and on solemne dayes,</l>
<l>Singing prophetike Elegies and Layes:</l>
<l>And fingring of a silver Lute she tide,</l>
<l>With black and purple skarfs by her left side.</l>
<l><name>Apollo</name> gave it, and her skill withall,</l>
<l>And she was term'd his Dwarfe she was so small.</l>
<l>Yet great in vertue, for his beames enclosde</l>
<l>His vertues in her: never was proposde</l>
<l>Riddle to her, or Augurie, strange or new,</l>
<l>But she resolv'd it: never sleight tale flew</l>
<l>From her charmd lips, without important sence,</l>
<l>Shewne in some grave succeeding consequence.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>This little Silvane with her songs and tales,</l>
<l>Gave such estate to feasts and Nuptiales,</l>
<l>That though oft times she forewent Tragedies,</l>
<l>Yet for her strangenes still she pleasde their eyes,</l>
<l>And for her smalnes they admir'd her so,</l>
<l>They thought her perfect borne and could not grow.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>All eyes were on her: <name>Hero</name> did command</l>
<l>An Altar deckt with sacred state should stand,</l>
<l>At the Feasts upper end close by the Bride,</l>
<l>On which the pretie Nymph might sit espide.</l>
<l>Then all were silent; every one so heares,</l>
<l>As all their sences climbd into their eares:</l>

<l>Such quickning brightnes did his deere eyes dart,</l>
<l>Warme went their beames to his beholders hart.</l>
<l>In such pure leagues his beauties were combinde,</l>
<l>That there your Nuptiall contracts first were signde.</l>
<l>For as proportion, white and crimsine, meet</l>
<l>In Beauties mixture, all right deere, and sweet;</l>
<l>The eye responsible, the golden haire,</l>
<l>And none is held without the other, faire:</l>
<l>All spring together, all together fade;</l>
<l>Such intermixt affections should invade</l>
<l>Two perfect lovers: which being yet unseene,</l>
<l>Their vertues and their comforts copied beene,</l>
<l>In Beauties concord, subject to the eie;</l>
<l>And that, in <name>Hymen</name>, pleasde so matchleslie,</l>
<l>That lovers were esteemde in their full grace,</l>
<l>Like forme and colour mixt in <name>Hymens</name> face;</l>
<l>And such sweete concord was thought worthie then</l>
<l>Of torches, musick, feasts, and greatest men:</l>
<l>So <name>Hymen</name> lookt, that even the chastest minde</l>
<l>He mov'd to joyne in joyes of sacred kinde:</l>
<l>For onely now his chins first doune consorted</l>
<l>His heads rich fleece, in golden curles contorted;</l>
<l>And as he was so lov'd, he lov'd so too,</l>
<l>So should best bewties, bound by Nuptialls doo.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Bright <name>Eucharis</name>, who was by all men saide</l>
<l>The noblest, fayrest, and the richest maide,</l>
<l>Of all th'<name>Athenian</name> damzels, <name>Hymen</name> lov'd,</l>
<l>With such transmission, that his heart remov'd</l>
<l>From his white brest to hers; but her estate</l>

<l>Hope of requittall, the grand prise of love;</l>
<l>Nor could he heare or see but he must prove</l>
<l>How his rare bewties musick would agree</l>

<l>For he did all but <name>Eucharis</name> excell</l>

<l>Nor grast it <name>Hymen</name> yet; but many a dart</l>

<l>Forst to abstaine her sight, and then the flame</l>
<l>Rag'd in his bosome. O what griefe did fill him:</l>
<l>Sight made him sick, and want of sight did kill him.</l>
<l>The virgins wondred where <name>Diatia</name> stayd,</l>
<l>For so did <name>Hymen</name> terme himselfe a mayd.</l>
<l>At length with sickly lookes he greeted them:</l>
<l>Tis strange to see gainst what an extreame streame</l>
<l>A lover strives; poore <name>Hymen</name> lookt so ill,</l>
<l>That as in merit he increased still,</l>
<l>By suffring much, so he in grace decreast.</l>

<l>And <name>Hymen</name> soone recovering all he lost,</l>
<l>Deceiving still these maids, but himselfe most,</l>
<l>His love and he with many virgin dames,</l>
<l>Noble by birth, noble by beauties <name>flames</name>,</l>
<l>Leaving the towne with songs and hallowed lights,</l>
<l>To doe great <name>Ceres Eleusina</name> rites</l>
<l>Of zealous Sacrifice; were made a pray</l>
<l>To barbarous Rovers that in ambush lay,</l>
<l>And with rude hands enforst their shining spoyle,</l>
<l>Farre from the darkned Citie, tir'd with toyle.</l>
<l>And when the yellow issue of the skie</l>
<l>Came trouping forth, jelous of crueltie</l>
<l>To their bright fellowes of this under heaven,</l>
<l>Into a double night they saw them driven,</l>
<l>A horride Cave, the theeves black mansion,</l>
<l>Where wearie of the journey they had gon,</l>
<l>Their last nights watch, and drunke with their sweete gains,</l>
<l>Dull <name>Morpheus</name> entred, laden with silken chains,</l>
<l>Stronger then iron, and bound the swelling vaines</l>
<l>And tyred sences of these lawles Swaines.</l>
<l>But when the virgin lights thus dimly burnd;</l>
<l>O what a hell was heaven in! how they mournd</l>
<l>And wrung their hands, and wound their gentle forms</l>
<l>Into the shapes of sorrow! Golden storms</l>
<l>Fell from their eyes: As when the Sunne appeares,</l>
<l>And yet it raines, so shewd their eyes their teares.</l>
<l>And as when funerall dames watch a dead corse,</l>
<l>Weeping about it, telling with remorse</l>
<l>What paines he felt, how long in paine he lay,</l>
<l>How little food he eate, what he would say;</l>
<l>And then mixe mournfull tales of others deaths,</l>
<l>Smothering themselves in clowds of their owne breaths;</l>
<l>At length, one cheering other, call for wine,</l>
<l>The golden boale drinks teares out of their eine,</l>
<l>As they drinke wine from it; and round it goes,</l>
<l>Each helping other to relieve their woes:</l>
<l>So cast these virgins beauties mutuall raies,</l>
<l>One lights another, face the face displaies;</l>
<l>Lips by reflexion kist, and hands hands shooke,</l>
<l>Even by the whitenes each of other tooke.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>But <name>Hymen</name> now usde friendly <name>Morpheus</name> aide,</l>
<l>Slew every theefe, and rescude every maide.</l>
<l>And now did his enamourd passion take</l>
<l>Hart from his hartie deede, whose worth did make</l>
<l>His hope of bounteous <name>Euckaris</name> more strong;</l>
<l>And now came Love with <name>Proteus</name>, who had long</l>
<l>Inggl'd the little god with prayers and gifts,</l>
<l>Ran through all shapes, and varied all his shifts,</l>
<l>To win Loves stay with him, and make him love him:</l>
<l>And when he saw no strength of sleight could move him</l>
<l>To make him love, or stay, he nimbly turnd</l>
<l>Into Loves selfe, he so extreamely burnd.</l>
<l>And thus came Love with <name>Proteus</name> and his powre,</l>
<l>T'encounter <name>Eucharis</name>: first like the flowre</l>
<l>That <name>Junos</name> milke did spring, the silver Lillie,</l>
<l>He fell on <name>Hymens</name> hand, who straight did spie</l>
<l>The bounteous Godhead, and with wondrous joy</l>
<l>Offred it <name>Eucharis</name>. She wondrous coy</l>
<l>Drew back her hand: the subtle flowre did woo it,</l>
<l>And drawing it neere, mixt so you could not know it.</l>
<l>As two deere Tapers mixe in one their light,</l>
<l>So did the Lillie and the hand their white:</l>
<l>She viewd it, and her view the forme bestowes</l>
<l>Amongst her spirits: for as colour flowes</l>
<l>From superficies of each thing we see,</l>
<l>Even so with colours formes emitted bee:</l>
<l>And where Loves forme is, Love is, Love is forme;</l>
<l>He entred at the eye, his sacred storme</l>
<l>Rose from the hand, Loves sweetest instrument:</l>
<l>It stird her bloods sea so, that high it went,</l>
<l>And beate in bashfull waves gainst the white shore</l>
<l>Of her divided cheekes; it rag'd the more,</l>
<l>Because the tide went gainst the haughtie winde</l>
<l>Of her estate and birth: And as we finde</l>
<l>In fainting ebs, the flowrie Zephire hurles</l>
<l>The greene-hayrd <name>Hellespont</name>, broke in silver curles,</l>
<l>Gainst <name>Heros</name> towre: but in his blasts retreate,</l>
<l>The waves obeying him, they after beate,</l>
<l>Leaving the chalkie shore a great way pale,</l>
<l>Then moyst it freshly with another gale:</l>
<l>So ebd and flowde the blood in <name>Eucharis</name> face,</l>
<l>Coynesse and Love striv'd which had greatest grace.</l>
<l>Virginitie did fight on Coynesse side;</l>
<l>Feare of her parents frownes, and femall pride,</l>
<l>Lothing the lower place, more then it loves</l>
<l>The high contents, desert and vertue moves.</l>
<l>With Love fought <name>Hymens</name> beautie and his valure,</l>
<l>Which scarce could so much favour yet allure</l>
<l>To come to strike, but fameles idle stood,</l>
<l><quote n="proverb">Action is firie valours soveraigne good.</quote></l>
<l>But Love once entred, wisht no greater ayde</l>
<l>Then he could find within; thought, thought betrayd.</l>

<l>Sung <name>Io Hymen</name>; there those songs begun,</l>
<l>And Love was growne so rich with such a game,</l>
<l>And wanton with the ease of his free raigne,</l>
<l>That he would turne into her roughest frownes</l>
<l>To turne them out; and thus he <name>Hymen</name> crownes</l>
<l>King of his thoughts, mans greatest Emperie:</l>
<l>This was his first brave step to deitie.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Home to the mourning cittie they repayre,</l>
<l>With newes as holesome as the morning ayre,</l>
<l>To the sad parents of each saved maid:</l>
<l>But <name>Hymen</name> and his <name>Eucharis</name> had laid</l>
<l>This plat, to make the flame of their delight</l>
<l>Round as the Moone at full, and full as bright.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Because the parents of chast <name>Eucharis</name></l>
<l>Exceeding <name>Hymens</name> so, might crosse their blis;</l>
<l>And as the world rewards deserts, that law</l>
<l>Cannot assist with force: so when they saw</l>
<l>Their daughter safe, take vantage of their owne,</l>
<l>Praise <name>Hymens</name> valour much, nothing bestowne:</l>
<l><name>Hymen</name> must leave the virgins in a Grove</l>
<l>Farre off from <name>Athens</name>, and go first to prove</l>
<l>If to restore them all with fame and life,</l>
<l>He should enjoy his dearest as his wife.</l>
<l>This told to all the maids; the most agree:</l>
<l>The riper sort knowing what t'is to bee</l>
<l>The first mouth of a newes so farre deriv'd,</l>
<l>And that to heare and beare newes brave folks liv'd,</l>
<l>As being a carriage speciall hard to beare</l>
<l>Occurrents, these occurrents being so deare,</l>
<l>They did with grace protest, they were content</l>
<l>T'accost their friends with all their complement,</l>
<l>For <name>Hymens</name> good: but to incurre their harme,</l>
<l>There he must pardon them. This wit went warme</l>
<l>To <name>Adolesches</name> braine, a Nymph borne hie,</l>
<l>Made all of voyce and fire, that upwards flie:</l>
<l>Her hart and all her forces nether traine</l>
<l>Climbd to her tongue, and thither fell her braine,</l>
<l>Since it could goe no higher, and it must go:</l>
<l>All powers she had, even her tongue, did so.</l>
<l>In spirit and quicknes she much joy did take,</l>
<l>And lov'd her tongue, only for quicknes sake,</l>
<l>And she would hast and tell. The rest all stay,</l>
<l><name>Hymen</name> goes one, the Nymph another way:</l>
<l>And what became of her Ile tell at last:</l>
<l>Yet take her visage now: moyst lipt, long fa'st,</l>
<l>Thin like an iron wedge, so sharpe and tart,</l>
<l>As twere of purpose made to cleave Loves hart.</l>
<l>Well were this lovely Beautie rid of her,</l>
<l>And <name>Hymen</name> did at <name>Athens</name> now prefer</l>
<l>His welcome suite, which he with joy aspirde:</l>
<l>A hundred princely youths with him retirde</l>
<l>To fetch the Nymphs: Chariots and Musick went,</l>
<l>And home they came: heaven with applauses rent.</l>
<l>The Nuptials straight proceed, whiles all the towne,</l>
<l>Fresh in their joyes might doe them most renowne.</l>
<l>First gold-lockt <name>Hymen</name> did to Church repaire,</l>
<l>Like a quick offring burnd in flames of haire.</l>
<l>And after, with a virgin firmament,</l>
<l>The Godhead-proving Bride, attended went</l>
<l>Before them all; she lookt in her command,</l>
<l>As if forme-giving <name>Cyprias</name> silver hand</l>
<l>Gripte all their beauties, and crusht out one flame;</l>
<l>She blusht to see how beautie overcame</l>
<l>The thoughts of all men. Next before her went</l>
<l>Five lovely children deckt with ornament</l>
<l>Of her sweet colours, bearing Torches by,</l>
<l>For light was held a happie Augurie</l>
<l>Of generation, whose efficient right</l>
<l>Is nothing else but to produce to light.</l>
<l>The od disparent number they did chuse,</l>
<l>To shew the union married loves should use,</l>
<l>Since in two equall parts it will not sever,</l>
<l>But the midst holds one to rejoyne it ever,</l>
<l>As common to both parts: men therfore deeme,</l>
<l>That equall number Gods does not esteeme,</l>
<l>Being authors of sweet peace and unitie,</l>
<l>But pleasing to th'infernall Emperie,</l>
<l>Under whose ensignes Wars and Discords fight,</l>
<l>Since an even number you may disunite</l>
<l>In two parts equall, nought in middle left,</l>
<l>To reunite each part from other reft:</l>
<l>And five they hold in most especiall prise,</l>
<l>Since t'is the first od number that doth rise</l>
<l>From the two formost numbers unitie</l>
<l>That od and even are; which are two, and three,</l>
<l>For one no number is: but thence doth flow</l>
<l>The powerfull race of number. Next did go</l>
<l>A noble Matron that did spinning beare</l>
<l>A huswifes rock and spindle, and did weare</l>
<l>A Weathers skin, with all the snowy fleece,</l>
<l>To intimate that even the daintiest peece,</l>
<l>And noblest borne dame should industrious bee:</l>
<l>That which does good disgraceth no degree.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>And now to <name>Junos</name> Temple they are come,</l>
<l>Where her grave Priest stood in the mariage rome.</l>
<l>On his right arme did hang a skarlet vaile,</l>
<l>And from his shoulders to the ground did traile,</l>
<l>On either side, Ribands of white and blew;</l>
<l>With the red vaile he hid the bashfull hew</l>
<l>Of the chast Bride, to shew the modest shame,</l>
<l>In coupling with a man should grace a dame.</l>
<l>Then tooke he the disparent Silks, and tide</l>
<l>The Lovers by the wasts, and side to side,</l>
<l>In token that thereafter they must binde</l>
<l>In one selfe sacred knot each others minde.</l>
<l>Before them on an Altar he presented</l>
<l>Both fire and water: which was first invented,</l>
<l>Since to ingenerate every humane creature,</l>
<l>And every other birth produ'st by Nature,</l>
<l>Moysture and heate must mixe: so man and wife</l>
<l>For humane race must joyne in Nuptiall life.</l>
<l>Then one of <name>Junos</name> Birds, the painted Jay,</l>
<l>He sacrifisde, and tooke the gall away.</l>
<l>All which he did behinde the Altar throw,</l>
<l>In signe no bitternes of hate should grow</l>
<l>Twixt maried loves, nor any least disdaine.</l>
<l>Nothing they spake, for twas esteemd too plaine</l>
<l>For the most silken mudnes of a maid,</l>
<l>To let a publique audience heare it said</l>
<l>She boldly tooke the man: and so respected</l>
<l>Was bashfulnes in <name>Athens</name>: it erected</l>
<l>To chast <name>Agneja</name>, which is Shamefastnesse,</l>
<l>A sacred Temple, holding her a Goddesse.</l>
<l>And now to Feasts, Masks, and triumphant showes,</l>
<l>The shining troupes returnd, even till earths throwes</l>
<l>Brought forth with joy the thickest part of night,</l>
<l>When the sweet Nuptiall song that usde to cite</l>
<l>All to their rest, was by <name>Phemonoe</name> sung:</l>
<l>First <name>Delphian</name> Prophetesse, whose graces sprung</l>
<l>Out of the <name>Muses</name> well, she sung before</l>
<l>The Bride into her chamber: at which dore</l>
<l>A Matron and a Torch-bearer did stand;</l>
<l>A painted box of Confits in her hand</l>
<l>The Matron held, and so did other some</l>
<l>That compast round the honourd Nuptiall rome.</l>
<l>The custome was that every maid did weare,</l>
<l>During her maidenhead, a silken Sphere</l>
<l>About her waste, above her inmost weede,</l>
<l>Knit with <name>Minervas</name> knot, and that was freede</l>
<l>By the faire Bridegrome on the manage night,</l>
<l>With many ceremonies of delight:</l>
<l>And yet eternisde <name>Hymens</name> tender Bride,</l>
<l>To suffer it dissolv'd so sweetly cride,</l>
<l>The maids that heard, so lov'd, and did adore her,</l>
<l>They wisht with all their hearts to suffer for her.</l>
<l>So had the Matrons, that with Confits stood</l>
<l>About the chamber, such affectionate blood,</l>
<l>And so true feeling of her harmeles paines,</l>
<l>That every one a showre of Confits raines.</l>
<l>For which the Brideyouths scrambling on the ground,</l>
<l>In noyse of that sweet haile her cryes were drownd.</l>
<l>And thus blest <name>Hymen</name> joyde his gracious Bride,</l>
<l>And for his joy was after deifide.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>The Saffron mirror by which <name>Phoebus</name> love,</l>
<l>Greene <name>Tellus</name> decks her, now he held above</l>
<l>The dowdy mountaines: and the noble maide,</l>
<l>Sharp-visag'd <name>Adolesche</name>, that was straide</l>
<l>Out of her way, in hasting with her newes,</l>
<l>Not till this houre th'<name>Athenian</name> turrets viewes:</l>
<l>And now brought home by guides, she heard by all</l>
<l>That her long kept occurrents would be stale,</l>
<l>And how faire <name>Hymens</name> honors did excell</l>
<l>For those rare newes, which she came short to tell.</l>
<l>To heare her deare tongue robd of such a joy,</l>
<l>Made the well-spoken Nymph take such a toy,</l>
<l>That downe she sunke: when lightning from above,</l>
<l>Shrunk her leane body, and for meere free love,</l>
<l>Turnd her into the pied-plum'd <name>Psittacus</name>,</l>
<l>That now the Parrat is surnam'd by us,</l>

<argument><head>THE ARGUMENT OF THE SIXT SESTYAD.</head>
<l><name>Leucote</name> flyes to all the windes,</l>

<l>That <name>Hero</name> and her love may meete.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> (with <name>Loves</name> compleate Fleete</l>
<l>Mand in himselfe) puts forth to Seas,</l>
<l>When straight the ruthles Destinies,</l>
<l>With <name>Ate</name> stirre the windes to warre</l>
<l>Upon the <name>Hellespont</name>: Their jarre</l>
<l>Drownes poore <name>Leander</name>. <name>Heros</name> eyes</l>
<l>Wet witnesses of his surprise,</l>
<l>Her Torch blowne out. Griefe casts her downe</l>
<l>Upon her love, and both doth drowne.</l>
<l>In whose just ruth the God of Seas</l>
<l>Transformes them to th'<name>Acanthides</name>.</l></argument>

<lg><l>No longer could the day nor Destinies</l>
<l>Delay the night, who now did frowning rise</l>
<l>Into her Throne; and at her humorous brests,</l>
<l>Visions and Dreames lay sucking: all mens rests</l>
<l>Fell like the mists of death upon their eyes,</l>
<l>Dayes too long darts so kild their faculties.</l>
<l>The windes yet, like the flowrs to cease began:</l>
<l>For bright <name>Leucote</name>, <name>Venus</name> whitest Swan,</l>
<l>That held sweet <name>Hero</name> deare, spread her fayre wings,</l>
<l>Like to a field of snow, and message brings</l>
<l>From <name>Venus</name> to the Fates, t'entreate them lay</l>
<l>Their charge upon the windes their rage to stay,</l>
<l>That the sterne battaile of the Seas might cease,</l>
<l>And guard <name>Leander</name> to his love in peace.</l>
<l>The Fates consent, (aye me dissembling Fates)</l>
<l>They shewd their favours to conceale their hates,</l>
<l>And draw <name>Leander</name> on, least Seas too hie</l>
<l>Should stay his too obsequious destinie:</l>
<l>Who like a fleering slavish Parasite,</l>
<l>In warping profit or a traiterous sleight,</l>
<l>Hoopes round his rotten bodie with devotes,</l>
<l>And pricks his descant face full of false notes,</l>
<l>Praysing with open throte (and othes as fowle</l>
<l>As his false heart) the beautie of an Owle,</l>
<l>Kissing his skipping hand with charmed skips,</l>
<l>That cannot leave, but leapes upon his lips</l>
<l>Like a cock-sparrow, or a shameles queane</l>
<l>Sharpe at a red-lipt youth, and nought doth meane</l>
<l>Of all his antick shewes, but doth repayre</l>
<l>More tender fawnes, and takes a scattred hayre</l>
<l>From his tame subjects shoulder; whips, and cals</l>
<l>For every thing he lacks; creepes gainst the wals</l>
<l>With backward humblesse, to give needles way:</l>
<l>Thus his false fate did with <name>Leander</name> play.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>First to black <name>Eurus</name> flies the white <name>Leucote</name>,</l>
<l>Borne mongst the <name>Negros</name> in the <name>Levant</name> Sea,</l>
<l>On whose curld head the glowing Sun doth rise,</l>
<l>And shewes the soveraigne will of Destinies,</l>
<l>To have him cease his blasts, and downe he lies.</l>
<l>Next, to the fennie <name>Notus</name>, course she holds,</l>
<l>And found him leaning with his armes in folds</l>
<l>Upon a rock, his white hayre full of showres,</l>
<l>And him she chargeth by the fatall powres,</l>
<l>To hold in his wet cheekes his clowdie voyce.</l>
<l>To <name>Zephire</name> then that doth in flowres rejoyce.</l>
<l>To snake-foote <name>Boreas</name> next she did remove,</l>
<l>And found him tossing of his ravisht love,</l>
<l>To heate his frostie bosome hid in snow,</l>
<l>Who with <name>Leucotes</name> sight did cease to blow.</l>
<l>Thus all were still to <name>Heros</name> harts desire,</l>
<l>Who with all speede did consecrate a fire</l>
<l>Of flaming Gummes, and comfortable Spice,</l>
<l>To light her Torch, which in such curious price</l>
<l>She held, being object to <name>Leanders</name> sight,</l>
<l>That nought but fires perfilm'd must give it light.</l>
<l>She lov'd it so, she griev'd to see it burne,</l>
<l>Since it would waste and soone to ashes turne:</l>
<l>Yet if it burnd not, twere not worth her eyes,</l>
<l>What made it nothing, gave it all the prize.</l>
<l>Sweet Torch, true Glasse of our societie;</l>
<l>What man does good, but he consumes thereby?</l>
<l>But thou wert lov'd for good, held high, given show:</l>
<l>Poore vertue loth'd for good, obscur'd, held low.</l>
<l>Doe good, be pinde; be deedles good, disgrast:</l>
<l>Unles we feede on men, we let them fast.</l>
<l>Yet <name>Hero</name> with these thoughts her Torch did spend.</l>
<l>When Bees makes waxe, Nature doth not intend</l>
<l>It shall be made a Torch: but we that know</l>
<l>The proper vertue of it make it so,</l>
<l>And when t'is made we light it: nor did Nature</l>
<l>Propose one life to maids, but each such creature</l>
<l>Makes by her soule the best of her free state,</l>
<l>Which without love is rude, disconsolate,</l>
<l>And wants Loves fire to make it milde and bright,</l>
<l>Till when, maids are but Torches wanting light.</l>
<l>Thus gainst our griefe, not cause of griefe we fight,</l>
<l>The right of nought is gleande, but the delight.</l>
<l>Up went she, but to tell how she descended,</l>
<l>Would God she were not dead, or my verse ended.</l>
<l>She was the rule of wishes, summe and end</l>
<l>For all the parts that did on love depend:</l>
<l>Yet cast the Torch his brightues further forth;</l>
<l>But what shines neerest best, holds truest worth.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> did not through such tempests swim</l>
<l>To kisse the Torch, although it lighted him:</l>
<l>But all his powres in her desires awaked,</l>
<l>Her love and vertues cloth'd him richly naked.</l>
<l>Men kisse but fire that only shewes pursue,</l>
<l>Her Torch and <name>Hero</name>, figure shew, and vertue.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Now at opposde <name>Abydus</name> nought was heard,</l>
<l>But bleating flocks, and many a bellowing herd,</l>
<l>Slaine for the Nuptials, cracks of falling woods,</l>
<l>Blowes of broad axes, powrings out of floods.</l>
<l>The guiltie <name>Hellespont</name> was mixt and stainde</l>
<l>With bloodie Torrents, that the shambles raind;</l>
<l>Not arguments of feast, but shewes that bled,</l>
<l>Foretelling that red night that followed.</l>
<l>More blood was spilt, more honors were addrest,</l>
<l>Then could have graced any happie feast.</l>
<l>Rich banquets, triumphs, every pomp employes</l>
<l>His sumptuous hand: no misers nuptiall joyes.</l>
<l>Ayre felt continuall thunder with the noyse,</l>
<l>Made in the generall manage violence.</l>
<l>And no man knew the cause of this expence,</l>
<l>But the two haples Lords, <name>Leanders</name> Sire,</l>
<l>And poore <name>Leander</name>, poorest where the fire</l>
<l>Of credulous love made him most rich surmisde.</l>
<l>As short was he of that himselfe he prisde,</l>
<l>As is an emptie Gallant full of forme,</l>
<l>That thinks each looke an act, each drop a storme,</l>
<l>That fals from his brave breathings; most brought up</l>
<l>In our <name>Metropolis</name>, and hath his cup</l>
<l>Brought after him to feasts; and much Palme beares,</l>
<l>For his rare judgement in th'attire he weares;</l>
<l>Hath seene the hot Low Countries, not their heat,</l>
<l>Observes their rampires and their buildings yet.</l>
<l>And for your sweet discourse with mouthes is heard</l>
<l>Giving instructions with his very beard.</l>
<l>Hath gone with an Ambassadour, and been</l>
<l>A great mans mate in travailing, even to <name>Rhene</name>,</l>
<l>And then puts all his worth in such a face,</l>
<l>As he saw brave men make, and strives for grace</l>
<l>To get his newes forth; as when you descrie</l>
<l>A ship with all her sayle contends to flie</l>
<l>Out of the narrow <name>Thames</name> with windes unapt,</l>
<l>Now crosseth here, then there, then this way rapt,</l>
<l>And then hath one point reacht; then alters all,</l>
<l>And to another crooked reach doth fall</l>
<l>Of halfe a burdbolts shoote; keeping more coyle,</l>
<l>Then if she danst upon the Oceans toyle:</l>
<l>So serious is his trifling companie,</l>
<l>In all his swelling ship of vacantrie.</l>
<l>And so short of himselfe in his high thought,</l>
<l>Was our <name>Leander</name> in his fortunes brought,</l>
<l>And in his fort of love that he thought won.</l>
<l>But otherwise he skornes comparison.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>O sweet <name>Leander</name>, thy large worth I hide</l>
<l>In a short grave; ill favourd stormes must chide</l>
<l>Thy sacred favour; I, in floods of inck</l>
<l>Must drowne thy graces, which white papers drink,</l>
<l>Even as thy beauties did the foule black Seas:</l>
<l>I must describe the hell of thy disease,</l>
<l>That heaven did merit: yet I needes must see</l>
<l>Our painted fooles and cockhorse Pessantrie</l>
<l>Still still usurp, with long lives, loves, and lust,</l>
<l>The seates of vertue, cutting short as dust</l>
<l>Her deare bought issue; ill, to worse converts,</l>
<l>And tramples in the blood of all deserts.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Night close and silent now goes fast before</l>
<l>The Captaines and their souldiers to the shore,</l>
<l>On whom attended the appointed Fleete</l>
<l>At <name>Sestus</name> Bay, that should <name>Leander</name> meete.</l>
<l>Who fainde he in another ship would passe:</l>
<l>Which must not be, for no one meane there was</l>
<l>To get his love home, but the course he tooke.</l>
<l>Forth did his beautie for his beautie looke,</l>
<l>And saw her through her Torch, as you beholde</l>
<l>Sometimes within the Sunne, a face of golde,</l>
<l>Form'd in strong thoughts, by that traditions force,</l>
<l>That saies a God sits there and guides his course.</l>
<l>His sister was with him, to whom he shewd</l>
<l>His guide by Sea: and sayd; Oft have you viewd</l>
<l>In one heaven many starres, but never yet</l>
<l>In one starre many heavens till now were met.</l>
<l>See lovely sister, see, now <name>Hero</name> shines</l>
<l>No heaven but her appeares: each star repines,</l>
<l>And all are clad in clowdes, as if they mournd,</l>
<l>To be by influence of Earth out-burnd.</l>
<l>Yet doth she shine, and teacheth vertues traine,</l>
<l>Still to be constant in Hels blackest raigne:</l>
<l>Though even the gods themselves do so entreat them</l>
<l>As they did hate, and Earth as she would eate them.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l>Off went his silken robe, and in he leapt;</l>
<l>Whom the kinde waves so licorously cleapt,</l>
<l>Thickning for haste one in another so,</l>
<l>To kisse his skin, that he might almost go</l>
<l>To <name>Heros</name> Towre, had that kind minuit lasted.</l>
<l>But now the cruell fates with <name>Ate</name> hasted</l>
<l>To all the windes, and made them battaile fight</l>
<l>Upon the <name>Hellespont</name>, for eithers right</l>
<l>Pretended to the windie monarchie.</l>
<l>And forth they brake, the Seas mixt with the side,</l>
<l>And tost distrest <name>Leander</name>, being in hell,</l>
<l>As high as heaven; Blisse not in height doth dwell.</l>
<l>The Destinies sate dancing on the waves,</l>
<l>To see the glorious windes with mutuall braves</l>
<l>Consume each other: O true glasse to see,</l>
<l>How ruinous ambitious Statists bee</l>
<l>To their owne glories! Poore <name>Leander</name> cried</l>
<l>For help to Sea-borne <name>Venus</name>; she denied:</l>
<l>To <name>Boreas</name>, that for his <name>Atthoeas</name> sake,</l>
<l>He would some pittie on his <name>Hero</name> take,</l>
<l>And for his owne loves sake, on his desires:</l>
<l>But Glorie never blowes cold Pitties fires.</l>
<l>Then calde he <name>Neptune</name>, who through all the noise,</l>
<l>Knew with affright his wrackt <name>Leanders</name> voice:</l>
<l>And up he rose, for haste his forehead hit</l>
<l>Gainst heavens hard Christall; his proud waves he smit</l>
<l>With his forkt scepter, that could not obay,</l>
<l>Much greater powers then <name>Neptunes</name> gave them sway.</l>
<l>They lov'd <name>Leander</name> so, in groanes they brake</l>
<l>When they came neere him; and such space did take</l>
<l>Twixt one another, loth to issue on,</l>
<l>That in their shallow furrowes earth was shone,</l>
<l>And the poore lover tooke a little breath:</l>
<l>But the curst Fates sate spinning of his death</l>
<l>On every wave, and with the servile windes</l>
<l>Tumbled them on him: And now <name>Hero</name> findes</l>
<l>By that she felt, her deare <name>Leanders</name> state.</l>
<l>She wept and prayed for him to every fate,</l>
<l>And every winde that whipt her with her haire</l>
<l>About the face, she kist and spake it faire,</l>
<l>Kneeld to it, gave it drinke out of her eyes</l>
<l>To quench his thirst: but still their cruelties</l>
<l>Even her poore Torch envied, and rudely beate</l>
<l>The bating flame from that deare foode it eate:</l>
<l>Deare, for it nourisht her <name>Leanders</name> life,</l>
<l>Which with her robe she rescude from their strife:</l>
<l>But silke too soft was, such hard hearts to breake,</l>
<l>And she deare soule, even as her silke, faint, weake,</l>
<l>Could not preserve it: out, O out it went.</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> still cald <name>Neptune</name>, that now rent</l>
<l>His brackish curles, and tore his wrinckled face</l>
<l>Where teares in billowes did each other chace,</l>
<l>And (burst with ruth) he hurld his marble Mace</l>
<l>At the sterne Fates: it wounded <name>Lachesis</name></l>
<l>That drew <name>Leanders</name> thread, and could not misse</l>
<l>The thread it selfe, as it her hand did hit,</l>
<l>But smote it full and quite did sunder it.</l>
<l>The more kinde <name>Neptune</name> rag'd, the more he raste</l>
<l>His loves lives fort, and kild as he embraste.</l>
<l>Anger doth still his owne mishap encrease;</l>
<l>If any comfort live, it is in peace.</l>
<l>O theevish Fates, to let Blood, Flesh, and Sence</l>
<l>Build two fayre Temples for their Excellence,</l>
<l>To rob it with a poysoned influence.	</l>
<l>Though soules gifts starve, the bodies are held dear</l>
<l>In ugliest things; Sence-sport preserves a Beare.</l>
<l>But here nought serves our turnes; O heaven and earth,</l>
<l>How most most wretched is our humane birth?</l>
<l>And now did all the tyrannous crew depart,</l>
<l>Knowing there was a storme in <name>Heros</name> hart,</l>
<l>Greater then they could make, and skornd their smart.</l>
<l>She bowd her selfe so low out of her Towre,</l>
<l>That wonder twas she fell not ere her howre,</l>
<l>With searching the lamenting waves for him;</l>
<l>Like a poore Snayle, her gentle supple lim</l>
<l>Hung on her Turrets top so most downe right,</l>
<l>As she would dive beneath the darknes quite,</l>
<l>To finde her Jewell; Jewell, her <name>Leander</name>,</l>
<l>A name of all earths Jewels pleasde not her,</l>
<l>Like his deare name: <name>Leander</name>, still my choice,</l>
<l>Come nought but my <name>Leander</name>; O my voice</l>
<l>Turne to <name>Leander</name>: hence-forth be all sounds,</l>
<l>Accents, and phrases that shew all griefes wounds,</l>
<l>Analisde in <name>Leander</name>. O black change!</l>
<l>Trumpets doe you with thunder of your clange,</l>
<l>Drive out this changes horror, my voyce faints:</l>
<l>Where all joy was, now shrieke out all complaints.</l>
<l>Thus cryed she, for her mixed soule could tell</l>
<l>Her love was dead: And when the morning fell</l>
<l>Prostrate upon the weeping earth for woe,</l>
<l>Blushes that bled out of her cheekes did show,</l>
<l><name>Leander</name> brought by <name>Neptune</name>, brusde and torne</l>
<l>With Citties ruines he to Rocks had worne,</l>
<l>To filthie usering Rocks that would have blood,</l>
<l>Though they could get of him no other good.</l>
<l>She saw him, and the sight was much much more,</l>
<l>Then might have serv'd to kill her; should her store</l>
<l>Of giant sorrowes speake? Burst, dye, bleede,</l>
<l>And leave poore plaints to us that shall succeede.</l>
<l>She fell on her loves bosome, hugg'd it fast,</l>
<l>And with <name>Leanders</name> name she breath'd her last.</l>
</lg>
<lg><l><name>Neptune</name> for pittie in his armes did take them,</l>
<l>Flung them into the ayre, and did awake them</l>
<l>Like two sweet birds surnam'd th'<name>Acanthides</name>,</l>
<l>Which we call Thistle-warps, that neere no Seas</l>
<l>Dare ever come, but still in couples flie,</l>
<l>And feede on Thistle tops, to testifie</l>
<l>The hardnes of their first life in their last:</l>
<l>The first in thornes of love, and sorrowes past.</l>
<l>And so most beautifull their colours show,</l>
<l>As none (so little) like them: her sad brow</l>
<l>A sable velvet feather covers quite,</l>
<l>Even like the forehead cloths that in the night,</l>
<l>Or when they sorrow, Ladies use to weare:</l>
<l>Their wings blew, red and yellow mixt appeare,</l>
<l>Colours, that as we construe colours paint</l>
<l>Their states to life; the yellow shewes their saint,</l>
<l>The devill <name>Venus</name>, left them; blew their truth,</l>
<l>The red and black, ensignes of death and ruth.</l>
<l>And this true honor from their love-deaths sprung,</l>
<l>They were the first that ever Poet sung.</l></lg>
