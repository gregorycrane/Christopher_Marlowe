<l>We which were <name>Ovids</name> five books, now are three,</l>
<l>For these before the rest preferreth he:</l>
<l>If reading five thou plainst of tediousnesse,</l>
<l>Two tane away, thy labor will be lesse:</l>
<l>With Muse upreard I meant to sing of armes,</l>
<l>Choosing a subject fit for feirse alarmes:</l>
<l>Both verses were alike till Love (men say)</l>
<l>Began to smile and tooke one foote away.</l>
<l>Rash boy, who gave thee power to change a line?</l>
<l>We are the Muses prophets, none of thine.</l>
<l>What if thy Mother take <name>Dianas</name> bowe,</l>
<l>Shall <name>Dian</name> fanne when love begins to glowe?</l>
<l>In wooddie groves ist meete that <name>Ceres</name> Raigne,</l>
<l>And quiver bearing <name>Dian</name> till the plaine:</l>
<l>Who'le set the faire treste sunne in battell ray,</l>
<l>While <name>Mars</name> doth take the <name>Aonian</name> harpe to play?</l>
<l>Great are thy kingdomes, over strong and large,</l>
<l>Ambitious Imp, why seekst thou further charge?</l>
<l>Are all things thine? the Muses <name>Tempe</name> thine?</l>
<l>Then scarse can <name>Phoebus</name> say, this harpe is mine.</l>
<l>When in this workes first verse I trod aloft,</l>
<l>Love slackt my Muse, and made my numbers soft.</l>
<l>I have no mistris, nor no favorit,</l>
<l>Being fittest matter for a wanton wit,</l>
<l>Thus I complaind, but Love unlockt his quiver,</l>
<l>Tooke out the shaft, ordaind my hart to shiver:</l>
<l>And bent his sinewy bow upon his knee,</l>
<l>Saying, Poet heers a worke beseeming thee.</l>
<l>Oh woe is me, he never shootes but hits,</l>
<l>I burne, love in my idle bosome sits.</l>
<l>Let my first verse be sixe, my last five feete,</l>
<l>Fare well sterne warre, for blunter Poets meete.</l>
<l><name>Elegian Muse</name>, that warblest amorous laies,</l>
<l>Girt my shine browe with sea banke mirtle praise.</l>

<argument lang="la"><p>Quodprimo Amore correptus,
in triumphum duci se a Cupidine patiatur</p></argument>

<l>What makes my bed seem hard seeing it is soft?</l>
<l>Or why slips downe the Coverlet so oft?</l>
<l>Although the nights be long, I sleepe not tho,</l>
<l>My sides are sore with tumbling to and fro.</l>
<l>Were Love the cause, it's like I shoulde descry him,</l>
<l>Or lies he close, and shoots where none can spie him?</l>
<l>T'was so, he stroke me with a slender dart,</l>
<l>Tis cruell love turmoyles my captive hart.</l>
<l>Yeelding or striving doe we give him might,</l>
<l>Lets yeeld, a burden easly borne is light.</l>
<l>I saw a brandisht fire increase in strength,</l>
<l>Which being not shakt, I saw it die at length.</l>
<l>Yong oxen newly yokt are beaten more,</l>
<l>Then oxen which have drawne the plow before.</l>
<l>And rough jades mouths with stubburn bits are tome,</l>
<l>But managde horses heads are lightly borne,</l>
<l>Unwilling Lovers, love doth more torment,</l>
<l>Then such as in their bondage feele content.</l>
<l>Loe I confesse, I am thy captive I,</l>
<l>And hold my conquered hands for thee to tie.</l>
<l>What needes thou warre, I sue to thee for grace,</l>
<l>With armes to conquer armlesse men is base,</l>
<l>Yoke <name>Venus</name>Doves, put Mirtle on thy haire,</l>
<l><name>Vulcan</name> will give thee Chariots rich and faire.</l>
<l>The people thee applauding thou shalte stand,</l>
<l>Guiding the harmelesse Pigeons with thy hand.</l>
<l>Yong men and women, shalt thou lead as thrall,</l>
<l>So will thy triumph seeme magnificall.</l>
<l>I lately cought, will have a new made wound,</l>
<l>And captive like be manacled and bound.</l>
<l>Good meaning, shame, and such as seeke loves wrack</l>
<l>Shall follow thee, their hands tied at their backe.</l>
<l>Thee all shall feare and worship as a King,</l>
<l><name>Jo</name>, triumphing shall thy people sing.</l>
<l>Smooth speeches, feare and rage shall by thee ride,</l>
<l>Which troopes hath alwayes bin on <name>Cupids</name> side:</l>
<l>Thou with these souldiers conquerest gods and men,</l>
<l>Take these away, where is thy honor then?</l>
<l>Thy mother shall from heaven applaud this show,</l>
<l>And on their faces heapes of Roses strow.</l>
<l>With beautie of thy wings, thy faire haire guilded,</l>
<l>Ride golden Love in Chariots richly builded.</l>
<l>Unlesse I erre, full many shalt thou burne,</l>
<l>And give woundes infinite at everie turne.</l>
<l>In spite of thee, forth will thy arrowes flie,</l>
<l>A scorching flame burnes all the standers by.</l>
<l>So having conquerd <name>Inde</name>, was <name>Bacchus</name> hew,</l>
<l>Thee Pompous birds and him two tygres drew.</l>
<l>Then seeing I grace thy show in following thee,</l>
<l>Forbeare to hurt thy selfe in spoyling mee.</l>
<l>Beholde thy kinsmans <name>Caesars</name> prosperous bandes,</l>

<argument lang="la"><p>Amicam, qua arte, quibusve nutibus in coena, proesente
viro uti debeat, admonet</p></argument>

<l>Thy husband to a banquet goes with me,</l>
<l>Pray God it may his latest supper be,</l>
<l>Shall I sit gazing as a bashfull guest,</l>
<l>While others touch the damsell I love best?</l>
<l>Wilt lying under him his bosome clippe?</l>
<l>About thy neck shall he at pleasure skippe?</l>
<l>Marveile not though the faire Bride did incite</l>
<l>The drunken <name>Centaures</name> to a sodaine fight.</l>
<l>I am no halfe horse, nor in woods I dwell,</l>
<l>Yet scarse my hands from thee containe I well.</l>
<l>But how thou shouldst behave thy selfe now know;</l>
<l>Nor let the windes away my warnings blowe.</l>
<l>Before thy husband come, though I not see</l>
<l>What may be done, yet there before him bee.</l>
<l>Lie with him gently, when his limbes he spread</l>
<l>Upon the bed, but on my foote first tread.</l>
<l>View me, my becks, and speaking countenance:</l>
<l>Take, and receive each secret amorous glaunce.</l>
<l>Words without voyce shall on my eye browes sit,</l>
<l>Lines thou shalt read in wine by my hand writ.</l>
<l>When our lascivious toyes come in thy minde,</l>
<l>Thy Rosie cheekes be to thy thombe inclinde.</l>
<l>If ought of me thou speak'st in inward thought,</l>
<l>Let thy soft finger to thy eare be brought.</l>
<l>When I (my light) do or say ought that please thee,</l>
<l>Turne round thy gold-ring, ass it were to ease thee.</l>
<l>Strike on the boord like them that pray for evill,</l>
<l>When thou doest wish thy husband at the devill.</l>
<l>What wine he fills thee, wisely will him drinke,</l>
<l>Aske thou the boy, what thou enough doest thinke.</l>
<l>When thou hast tasted, I will take the cup,</l>
<l>And where thou drinkst, on that part I will sup.</l>
<l>If hee gives thee what first himselfe did tast,</l>
<l>Even in his face his offered Gobbets cast.</l>
<l>Let not thy necke by his vile armes be prest,</l>
<l>Nor leane thy soft head on his boistrous brest.</l>
<l>Thy bosomes Roseat buds let him not finger,</l>
<l>Chiefely on thy lips let not his lips linger.</l>
<l>If thou givest kisses, I shall all disclose,</l>
<l>Say they are mine, and hands on thee impose.</l>
<l>Yet this Ile see, but if thy gowne ought cover,</l>
<l>Suspitious feare in all my veines will hover,</l>
<l>Mingle not thighes, nor to his legge joyne thine,</l>
<l>Nor thy soft foote with his hard foote combine.</l>
<l>I have beene wanton, therefore am perplext,</l>
<l>And with mistrust of the like measure vext.</l>
<l>I and my wench oft under clothes did lurke,</l>
<l>When pleasure mov'd us to our sweetest worke.</l>
<l>Do not thou so, but throw thy mantle hence,</l>
<l>Least I should thinke thee guilty of offence.</l>
<l>Entreat thy husband drinke, but do not kisse,</l>
<l>And while he drinkes, to adde more do not misse,</l>
<l>If hee lyes downe with Wine and sleepe opprest,</l>
<l>The thing and place shall counsell us the rest.</l>
<l>When to go homewards we rise all along,</l>
<l>Have care to walke in middle of the throng.</l>
<l>There will I finde thee, or be found by thee,</l>
<l>There touch what ever thou canst touch of mee.</l>
<l>Aye me I warne what profits some few howers,</l>
<l>But we must part, when heav'n with black night lowers.</l>
<l>At night thy husband clippes thee, I will weepe</l>
<l>And to the dores sight of thy selfe will keepe:</l>
<l>Then will he kisse thee, and not onely kisse</l>
<l>But force thee give him my stolne honey blisse.</l>
<l>Constrain'd against thy will give it the pezant,</l>
<l>Forbeare sweet wordes, and be your sport unpleasant.</l>
<l>To him I pray it no delight may bring,</l>
<l>Or if it do, to thee no joy thence spring:</l>
<l>But though this night thy fortune be to trie it,</l>
<l>To me to morrow constantly deny it.</l>

<argument lang="la"><p>Corinnae concubitus</p></argument>

<l>In summers heate, and midtime of the day,</l>
<l>To rest my limbes, uppon a bedde I lay,</l>
<l>One window shut, the other open stood,</l>
<l>Which gave such light, as twincles in a wood,</l>
<l>Like twilight glimps at setting of the sunne,</l>
<l>Or night being past, and yet not day begunne.</l>
<l>Such light to shamefaste maidens must be showne,</l>
<l>Where they may sport, and seeme to be unknowne.</l>
<l>Then came <name>Corinna</name> in a long loose gowne,</l>
<l>Her white necke hid with tresses hanging downe,</l>
<l>Resembling faire <name>Semiramis</name> going to bed,</l>
<l>Or <name>Layis</name> of a thousand lovers sped.</l>
<l>I snatcht her gowne: being thin, the harme was small,</l>
<l>Yet strivde she to be covered therewithall,</l>
<l>And striving thus as one that would be cast,</l>
<l>Betrayde her selfe, and yeelded at the last.</l>
<l>Starke naked as she stood before mine eie,</l>
<l>Not one wen in her bodie could I spie,</l>
<l>What armes and shoulders did I touch and see,</l>
<l>How apt her breasts were to be prest by me,</l>
<l>How smoothe a bellie, under her waste sawe I,</l>
<l>How large a legge, and what a lustie thigh?</l>
<l>To leave the rest, all likt me passing well,</l>
<l>I clinged her naked bodie, downe she fell,</l>
<l>Judge you the rest, being tyrde she bad me kisse.</l>

<l>Unworthy porter, bound in chaines full sore,</l>
<l>On mooved hookes set ope the churlish dore.</l>
<l>Little I aske, a little entrance make,</l>
<l>The gate halfe ope my bent side in will take.</l>
<l>Long Love my body to such use makes slender</l>
<l>And to get out doth like apt members render.</l>
<l>He shewes me how unheard to passe the watch,</l>
<l>And guides my feete least stumbling falles they catch.</l>
<l>But in times past I fear'd vaine shades, and night,</l>
<l>Wondring if any walked without light.</l>
<l>Love hearing it laugh'd with his tender mother</l>
<l>And smiling sayed, be thou as bold as other.</l>
<l>Forth-with Love came, no darke night-flying spright</l>
<l>Nor hands prepar'd to slaughter, me affright.</l>
<l>Thee feare I too much: only thee I flatter,</l>
<l>Thy lightning can my life in pieces batter.</l>
<l>Why enviest me, this hostile denne unbarre,</l>
<l>See how the gates with my teares wat'red are.</l>
<l>When thou stood'st naked ready to be beate,</l>
<l>For thee I did thy mistris faire entreate.</l>
<l>But what entreates for thee some-times tooke place,</l>

<l>With armes or armed men I come not guarded,</l>

<l>Although I would, I cannot him cashiere</l>
<l>Before I be divided from my geere.</l>
<l>See Love with me, wine moderate in my braine,</l>

<l>Who feares these armes? who wil not go to meete them?</l>
<l>Night runnes away; with open entrance greete them.</l>
<l>Art carelesse? or ist sleepe forbids thee heare,</l>
<l>Giving the windes my words running in thine eare?</l>
<l>Well I remember when I first did hire thee,</l>
<l>Watching till after mid-night did not tire thee.</l>
<l>But now perchaunce thy wench with thee doth rest,</l>
<l>Ah howe thy lot is above my lot blest:</l>
<l>Though it be so, shut me not out therefore,</l>
<l>Night goes away: I pray thee ope the dore.</l>
<l>Erre we? or do the turned hinges sound,</l>

<l>We erre: a strong blast seem'd the gates to ope:</l>

<l>Silent the Cittie is: nights deawie hoast</l>
<l>March fast away: the barre strike from the poast.</l>
<l>Or I more sterne then fire or sword will turne,</l>

<l>Night, Love, and wine to all extreames perswade:</l>
<l>Night shamelesse, wine and Love are fearelesse made.</l>

<l>No pritty wenches keeper maist thou bee:</l>
<l>The carefull prison is more meete for thee.</l>
<l>Now frosty night her flight beginnes to take,</l>
<l>And crowing Cocks poore soules to worke awake.</l>
<l>But thou my crowne, from sad haires tane away,</l>
<l>On this hard threshold till the morning lay.</l>
<l>That when my mistresse there beholds thee cast,</l>
<l>She may perceive how we the time did wast:</l>

<l>And on her necke a wantons marke not missing.</l>
<l>But though I like a swelling floud was driven,</l>
<l>And as a pray unto blinde anger given,</l>
<l>Wa'st not enough the fearefull Wench to chide?</l>
<l>Nor thunder in rough threatings haughty pride?</l>
<l>Nor shamefully her coate pull ore her crowne,</l>
<l>Which to her wast her girdle still kept downe.</l>
<l>But cruelly her tresses having rent,</l>
<l>My nayles to scratch her lovely cheekes I bent.</l>
<l>Sighing she stood, her bloodlesse white lookes shewed</l>
<l>Like marble from the <name>Parian</name>Mountaines hewed.</l>
<l>Her halfe dead joynts, and trembling limmes I sawe,</l>
<l>Like <name>Popler</name> leaves blowne with a stormy flawe,</l>
<l>Or slender eares, with gentle <name>Zephire</name> shaken,</l>
<l>Or waters tops with the warme south-winde taken.</l>
<l>And downe her cheekes, the trickling teares did flow,</l>
<l>Like water gushing from consuming snowe.</l>
<l>Then first I did perceive I had offended,</l>
<l>My bloud, the teares were that from her descended.</l>
<l>Before her feete thrice prostrate downe I fell,</l>
<l>My feared hands thrice back she did repell.</l>
<l>But doubt thou not (revenge doth griefe appease)</l>
<l>With thy sharpe nayles upon my face to seaze.</l>
<l>Bescratch mine eyes, spare not my lockes to breake,</l>
<l>(Anger will helpe thy hands though nere so weake.)</l>
<l>And least the sad signes of my crime remaine,</l>
<l>Put in their place thy keembed haires againe.</l>

<l>There is, who ere will knowe a bawde aright</l>
<l>Give eare, there is an old trot <name>Dipsas</name> hight.</l>
<l>Her name comes from the thing: she being wise,</l>
<l>Sees not the morne on rosie horses rise.</l>
<l>She magick arts and <name>Thessale</name> charmes doth know,</l>
<l>And makes large streams back to their fountaines flow,</l>
<l>She knows with gras, with thrids on wrong wheeles spun</l>
<l>And what with Mares ranck humour may be done.</l>
<l>When she will, cloudes the darckned heav'n obscure,</l>
<l>When she will, day shines every where most pure.</l>
<l>(If I have faith) I sawe the starres drop bloud,</l>
<l>The purple moone with sanguine visage stood.</l>
<l>Her I suspect among nights spirits to fly,</l>
<l>And her old body in birdes plumes to lie.</l>
<l>Fame saith as I suspect, and in her eyes</l>
<l>Two eye-balles shine, and double light thence flies.</l>
<l>Great grand-sires from their antient graves she chides</l>
<l>And with long charmes the solide earth divides.</l>
<l>She drawes chast women to incontinence,</l>
<l>Nor doth her tongue want harmefull eloquence.</l>
<l>By chaunce I heard her talke, these words she sayd</l>
<l>While closely hid betwixt two dores I layed.</l>
<l>Mistris thou knowest, thou hast a blest youth pleas'd,</l>
<l>He staide, and on thy lookes his gazes seaz'd.</l>
<l>And why shouldst not please? none thy face exceedes,</l>
<l>Aye me, thy body hath no worthy weedes.</l>
<l>As thou art faire, would thou wert fortunate,</l>
<l>Wert thou rich, poore should not be my state.</l>
<l>Th'opposed starre of <name>Mars</name> hath done thee harme,</l>
<l>Now <name>Mars</name> is gone: <name>Venus</name> thy side doth warme,</l>
<l>And brings good fortune, a rich lover plants</l>
<l>His love on thee, and can supply thy wants.</l>
<l>Such is his forme as may with thine compare,</l>
<l>Would he not buy thee thou for him shouldst care.</l>
<l>She blusht: red shame becomes white cheekes, but this</l>
<l>If feigned, doth well; if true it doth amisse.</l>
<l>When on thy lappe thine eyes thou dost deject,</l>
<l>Each one according to his gifts respect.</l>
<l>Perhaps the<name>Sabines</name> rude, when <name>Tatius</name> raignde,</l>
<l>To yeeld their love to more then one disdainde.</l>
<l>Now<name>Mars</name> doth rage abroad without all pitty,</l>
<l>And<name>Venus</name> rules in her <name>Aeneas</name>Citty.</l>
<l>Faire women play, shee's chast whom none will have,</l>
<l>Or, but for bashfulnesse her selfe would crave.</l>
<l>Shake off these wrinckles that thy front assault,</l>
<l>Wrinckles in beauty is a grievous fault.</l>
<l><name>Penelope</name> in bowes her youths strength tride,</l>
<l>Of horne the bowe was uthat approv'd their side.</l>
<l>Time flying slides hence closely, and deceaves us,</l>
<l>And with swift horses the swift yeare soone leaves us.</l>
<l>Brasse shines with use; good garments would be worne,</l>
<l>Houses not dwelt in, are with filth forlorne.</l>
<l>Beauty not exercisde with age is spent,</l>
<l>Nor one or two men are sufficient.</l>
<l>Many to rob is more sure, and lesse hateflill,</l>
<l>From dog-kept flocks come preys to woolves most gratefull.</l>
<l>Behold what gives the Poet but new verses?</l>
<l>And thereof many thousand he rehearses.</l>
<l>The Poets God arayed in robes of gold,</l>
<l>Of his gilt Harpe the well tun'd strings doth hold.</l>
<l>Let<name>Homer</name> yeeld to such as presents bring,</l>
<l>(Trust me) to give, it is a witty thing.</l>
<l>Nor, so thou maist obtaine a wealthy prize,</l>
<l>The vaine name of inferiour slaves despize.</l>
<l>Nor let the arrnes of antient lines beguile thee,</l>
<l>Poore lover with thy gransires I exile thee.</l>
<l>Who seekes, for being faire, a night to have,</l>
<l>What he will give, with greater instance crave.</l>
<l>Make a small price, while thou thy nets doest lay,</l>
<l>Least they should fly, being tane, the tirant play.</l>
<l>Dissemble so, as lov'd he may be thought,</l>
<l>And take heed least he gets that love for nought.</l>
<l>Deny him oft, feigne now thy head doth ake:</l>
<l>And<name>Isis</name> now will shew what scuse to make.</l>
<l>Receive him soone, least patient use he gaine,</l>
<l>Or least his love oft beaten backe should waine.</l>
<l>To beggers shut, to bringers ope thy gate,</l>
<l>Let him within heare bard out lovers prate.</l>
<l>And as first wrongd the wronged some-times banish,</l>
<l>Thy fault with his fault so repuls'd will vanish.</l>
<l>But never give a spatious time to ire,</l>
<l>Anger delaide doth oft to hate retire.</l>
<l>And let thine eyes constrained learne to weepe,</l>
<l>That this, or that man may thy cheekes moist keepe.</l>
<l>Nor, if thou couzenst one, dread to for-sweare,</l>
<l>,, <name>Venus</name> to mockt men lendes a sencelesse eare.</l>
<l>Servants fit for thy purpose thou must hire</l>
<l>To teach thy lover, what thy thoughts desire.</l>
<l>Let them aske some-what, many asking little,</l>
<l>Within a while great heapes grow of a tittle.</l>
<l>And sister, Nurse, and mother spare him not,</l>
<l>By many hands great wealth is quickly got.</l>
<l>When causes fale thee to require a gift,</l>
<l>By keeping of thy birth make but a shift.</l>
<l>Beware least he unrival'd loves secure,</l>
<l>Take strife away, love doth not well endure.</l>
<l>On all the bed mens tumbling let him viewe</l>
<l>And thy neck with lascivious markes made blew.</l>
<l>Chiefely shew him the gifts, which others send:</l>
<l>If he gives nothing, let him from thee wend.</l>
<l>When thou hast so much as he gives no more,</l>
<l>Pray him to lend what thou maist nere restore.</l>
<l>Let thy tongue flatter, while thy minde harme-workes:</l>
<l>Under sweete hony deadly poison lurkes.</l>
<l>If this thou doest, to me by long use knowne,</l>
<l>Nor let my words be with the windes hence blowne,</l>
<l>Oft thou wilt say, live well, thou wilt pray oft,</l>
<l>That my dead bones may in their grave lie soft.</l>
<l>As thus she spake, my shadow me betraide,</l>
<l>With much a do my hands I scarsely staide.</l>
<l>But her bleare eyes, balde scalpes thin hoary flieces</l>
<l>And riveld cheekes I would have puld a pieces.</l>
<l>The gods send thee no house, a poore old age,</l>
<l>Perpetuall thirst, and winters lasting rage.</l>

<l>Alas she almost weepes, and her white cheekes,</l>
<l>Died red with shame, to hide from shame she seekes.</l>
<l>She holds, and viewes her old lockes in her lappe,</l>
<l>Aye me rare gifts unworthy such a happe.</l>

<l>Her trembling hand writ back she might not doo.</l>
<l>And asking why, this answeare she redoubled,</l>
<l>Because thy care too much thy Mistresse troubled.</l>
<l>Keeper if thou be wise cease hate to cherish,</l>

<l>Nor is her husband wise, what needes defence</l>

<l>And with swift Naggs drawing thy little Coach,</l>

<l>An old wood, stands uncut of long yeares space,</l>
<l>Tis credible some god-head haunts the place.</l>
<l>In midst thereof a stone-pav'd sacred spring,</l>
<l>Where round about small birdes most sweetely sing.</l>
<l>Heere while I walke hid close in shadie grove,</l>
<l>To finde, what worke my muse might move, I strove.</l>
<l><name>Elegia</name> came with haires perfumed sweete,</l>
<l>And one, I thinke, was longer, of her feete.</l>
<l>A decent forme, thinne robe, a lovers looke,</l>
<l>By her footes blemish greater grace she tooke.</l>
<l>Then with huge steps came violent <name>Tragedie</name>,</l>
<l>Sterne was her front, her cloake on ground did lie.</l>
<l>Her left hand held abroad a regal scepter,</l>
<l>The <name>Lydian</name> buskin in fit paces kept her.</l>
<l>And first she sayd, when will thy love be spent,</l>
<l>O Poet carelesse of thy argument?</l>
<l>Wine-bibbing banquets tell thy naughtinesse,</l>
<l>Each crosse waies corner doth as much expresse.</l>
<l>Oft some points at the prophet passing by,</l>
<l>And this is he whom fierce love burnes, they cry.</l>
<l>A laughing stocke thou art to all the citty,</l>

<l>Tis time to move grave things in lofty stile,</l>
<l>Long hast thou loyterd, greater workes compile.</l>

<l>With scepters, and high buskins th'one would dresse me,</l>
<l>So through the world shold bright renown expresse me.</l>
<l>The other gives my love a conquering name,</l>
<l>Come therefore, and to long verse shorter frame.</l>
<l>Graunt <name>Tragedie</name> thy Poet times least tittle,</l>

<l><name>Argus</name> had either way an hundred eyes,</l>
<l>Yet by deceit Love did them all surprize.</l>
<l>In stone, and Yron walles <name>Danae</name> shut,</l>
<l>Came forth a mother, though a maide there put.</l>
<l><name>Penelope</name>, though no watch look'd unto her,</l>
<l>Was not defilde by any gallant wooer.</l>
<l>What's kept, we covet more: the care makes theft:</l>
<l>Few love, what others have unguarded left.</l>
<l>Nor doth her face please, but her husbands love;</l>
<l>I know not, what men thinke should thee so move.</l>
<l>She is not chaste, that's kept, but a deare whore:</l>
<l>Thy feare is, then her body, valued more.</l>
<l>Although thou chafe, stolne pleasure is sweet play,</l>
<l>She pleaseth best, I feare, if any say.</l>
<l>A free-borne wench, no right 'tis up to locke:</l>
<l>So use we women of strange nations stocke.</l>
<l>Because the keeper may come say, I did it,</l>
<l>She must be honest to thy servants credit.</l>
<l>He is too clownish, whom a lewd wife grieves,</l>
<l>And this townes well knowne customes not beleeves,</l>
<l>Where <name>Mars</name> his sonnes not without fault did breed,</l>
<l><name>Remus</name> and <name>Romulus, Ilias</name> twinne-borne seed.</l>
<l>Cannot a faire one, if not chast, please thee?</l>
<l>Never can these by any meanes agree.</l>
<l>Kindly thy mistris use, if thou be wise.</l>
<l>Looke gently, and rough husbands lawes despise.</l>
<l>Honour what friends thy wife gives, sheele give many:</l>
<l>Least labour so shall winne great grace of any.</l>
<l>So shalt thou go with youths to feasts together,</l>
<l>And see at home much, that thou nere broughtst thether.</l>

<l>Floud with reede-growne slime bankes, till I be past</l>
<l>Thy waters stay: I to my mistris hast.</l>
<l>Thou hast no bridge, nor boate with ropes to throw,</l>
<l>That may transport me without oares to rowe.</l>
<l>Thee I have pass'd, and knew thy streame none such,</l>
<l>When thy waves brim did scarse my anckles touch.</l>
<l>With snow thaw'd from the next hill now thou rushest,</l>
<l>And in thy foule deepe waters thicke thou gushest.</l>
<l>What helpes my hast: what to have tane small rest?</l>
<l>What day and night to travaile in her quest?</l>
<l>If standing here I can by no meanes get,</l>

<l>Now wish I those wings noble <name>Perseus</name> had,</l>

<l>I speake old Poets wonderfull inventions,</l>
<l>Nere was, nor shall be, what my verse mentions.</l>
<l>Rather thou large banke over-flowing river,</l>
<l>Slide in thy bounds, so shalt thou runne for ever.</l>
<l>(Trust me) land-streame thou shalt no envie lack,</l>
<l>If I a lover bee by thee held back.</l>
<l>Great flouds ought to assist young men in love,</l>
<l>Great flouds the force of it do often prove.</l>
<l>In mid <name>Bithynia</name>'tis said <name>Inachus</name>,</l>

<l><name>Troy</name> had not yet beene ten yeares siege out-stander,</l>
<l>Whem nimph-Necera rapt thy lookes <name>Scamander</name>.</l>
<l>What? not <name>Alpheus</name> in strange lands to runne,</l>

<l>If <name>Achelous</name>, I aske where thy hornes stand,</l>
<l>Thou saiest broke with <name>Alcides</name> angry hand.</l>
<l>Not <name>Calydon</name>, nor <name>Aetolia</name> did please:</l>
<l>One <name>Dejanira</name> was more worth then these.</l>
<l>Rich <name>Nile</name> by seaven mouthes to the vast sea flowing,</l>
<l>Who so well keepes his waters head from knowing,</l>
<l>Is by <name>Evadne</name> thought to take such flame,</l>
<l>As his deepe whirle-pooles could not quench the same.</l>
<l>Drye <name>Enipeus, Tyro</name> to embrace,</l>
<l>Flye backe his streame chargd, the streame chargd, gave place.</l>
<l>Nor passe I thee, who hollow rocks downe tumbling,</l>
<l>In <name>Tiburs</name> field with watry fome art rumbling,</l>
<l>Whom <name>Ilia</name> pleasd, though in her lookes griefe reveld,</l>
<l>Her cheekes were scratcht, her goodly haires discheveld.</l>
<l>She wailing <name>Mars</name> sinne, and her uncles crime,</l>
<l>Strayd bare-foote through sole places on a time.</l>
<l>Her, from his swift waves, the bold floud perceav'd,</l>
<l>And from the mid foord his hoarse voice upheav'd,</l>
<l>Saying, why sadly treadst my banckes upon,</l>
<l><name>Iija</name>, sprung from <name>Idaen Laomedon</name>?</l>
<l>Where's thy attire? why wand'rest heere alone?</l>
<l>To stay thy tresses white veyle hast thou none?</l>
<l>Why weepst? and spoilst with teares thy watry eyes?</l>
<l>And fiercely knockst thy brest that open lyes?</l>
<l>His heart consists of flint, and hardest steele,</l>
<l>That seeing thy teares can any joy then feele.</l>
<l>Feare not: to thee our Court stands open wide,</l>
<l>There shalt be lov'd: <name>Ilia</name> lay feare aside.</l>
<l>Thou ore a hundreth Nimphes, or more shalt raigne:</l>
<l>For five score Nimphes, or more our flouds conteine.</l>
<l>Nor <name>Romane</name> stocke scorne me so much (I crave)</l>
<l>Gifts then my promise greater thou shalt have.</l>
<l>This said he: shee her modest eyes held downe,</l>
<l>Her wofull bosome a warme shower did drowne.</l>
<l>Thrice she prepar'd to flie, thrice she did stay,</l>
<l>By feare depriv'd of strength to runne away.</l>
<l>Yet rending with enraged thumbe her tresses,</l>
<l>Her trembling mouth these unmeete sounds expresses.</l>
<l>O would in my fore-fathers tombe deepe layde,</l>
<l>My bones had beene, while yet I was a maide.</l>
<l>Why being a vestall am I wooed to wed,</l>
<l>Deflowr'd and stained in unlawfull bed?</l>
<l>Why stay I? men point at me for a whore,</l>
<l>Shame, that should make me blush, I have no more.</l>
<l>This said: her coate hood-winckt her fearefull eyes,</l>
<l>And into water desperately she flies.</l>
<l>Tis said the slippery streame held up her brest,</l>
<l>And kindly gave her, what she liked best.</l>
<l>And I beleeve some wench thou hast affected:</l>
<l>But woods and groves keepe your faults undetected.</l>
<l>While thus I speake, the waters more abounded:</l>
<l>And from the channell all abroad surrounded.</l>
<l>Mad streame, why doest our mutuall joyes deferre?</l>
<l>Clowne, from my journey why doest me deterre?</l>
<l>How wouldst thou flowe wert thou a noble floud,</l>
<l>If thy great fame in every region stood?</l>
<l>Thou hast no name, but com'st from snowy mountaines;</l>
<l>No certaine house thou hast, nor any fountaines.</l>
<l>Thy springs are nought but raine and melted snowe:</l>
<l>Which wealth, cold winter doth on thee bestowe.</l>
<l>Either th'art muddy in mid winter tide:</l>
<l>Or full of dust doest on the drye earth slide.</l>
<l>What thirstie traveller ever drunke of thee?</l>
<l>Who sayd with gratefull voyce perpetuall bee?</l>
<l>Harmefull to beasts, and to the fields thou proves:</l>
<l>Perchance these, others, me mine owne losse mooves.</l>
<l>To this I fondly loves of flouds told plainly:</l>
<l>I shame so great names to have usde so vainly:</l>
<l>I know not what expecting, I ere while</l>
<l>Nam'd <name>Achelaus</name>, <name>Inachus</name>, and <name>Nile</name>,</l>
<l>But for thy merits I wish thee, white streame,</l>
<l>Drye winters aye, and sunnes in heate extreame.</l>

<l>Either she was foule, or her attire was bad,</l>
<l>Or she was not the wench I wisht t'have had.</l>
<l>Idly I lay with her, as if I lovde not,</l>
<l>And like a burthen greevde the bed that mooved not.</l>
<l>Though both of us performd our true intent,</l>
<l>Yet could I not cast ancor where I meant,</l>
<l>She on my necke her Ivorie armes did throw,</l>
<l>That were as white as is the <name>Scithean</name> snow,</l>
<l>And eagerlie she kist me with her tongue,</l>
<l>And under mine her wanton thigh she fiong,</l>
<l>Yea, and she soothde me up, and calde me sir,</l>
<l>And usde all speech that might provoke and stirre.</l>
<l>Yet like as if cold hemlocke I had drunke,</l>
<l>It mocked me, hung down the head and suncke,</l>
<l>Like a dull Cipher, or rude blocke I lay,</l>
<l>Or shade, or body was I, who can say?</l>
<l>What will my age do, age I cannot shunne,</l>
<l>Seeing in my prime my force is spent and done?</l>
<l>I blush, that being youthfull, hot, and lustie,</l>
<l>I prove neither youth nor man, but old and rustie.</l>
<l>Pure rose shee, like a Nun to sacrifice,</l>
<l>Or one that with her tender brother lies,</l>
<l>Yet boorded I the golden <name>Chie</name> twise,</l>
<l>And <name>Libas</name>, and the white cheek'de <name>Pitho</name> thrise,</l>
<l><name>Corinna</name> cravde it in a summers night,</l>
<l>And nine sweete bouts had we before day light.</l>
<l>What, wast my limbs through some <name>Thesalian</name> charms,</l>
<l>May spelles and droughs do sillie soules such harmes?</l>
<l>With virgin waxe hath some imbast my joynts,</l>
<l>And pierst my liver with sharpe needle poynts?</l>
<l>Charmes change corne to grasse, and makes it dye,</l>
<l>By charmes are running springs and fountaines drie,</l>
<l>By charmes maste drops from okes, from vines grapes fall,</l>
<l>And fruit from trees, when ther's no wind at al.</l>
<l>Why might not then my sinews be inchanted,</l>
<l>And I grow faint, as with some spirit haunted?	</l>
<l>To this ad shame, shame to performe it quaild mee,</l>
<l>And was the second cause why vigor failde mee:</l>
<l>My idle thoughts delighted her no more,</l>
<l>Then did the robe or garment which she wore,</l>
<l>Yet might her touch make youthfull <name>Pilius</name> fire,</l>
<l>And <name>Tithon</name> livelier then his yeeres require.</l>
<l>Even her I had, and she had me in vaine,</l>
<l>What might I crave more if I aske againe?</l>
<l>I thinke the great Gods greeved they had bestowde</l>
<l>This benefite, which lewdly I forslowd:</l>

<l>To kisse, I kisse, to lie with her shee let me.</l>
<l>Why was I blest? why made king to refuse it?</l>
<l>Chuf-like had I not gold, and could not use it?</l>
<l>So in a spring thrives he that told so much,</l>
<l>And lookes uppon the fruits he cannot touch.</l>
<l>Hath any rose so from a fresh yong maide,</l>
<l>As she might straight have gone to church and praide:</l>
<l>Well, I beleeve she kist not as she should,</l>
<l>Nor usde the slight nor cunning which she could,</l>
<l>Huge okes, hard Adamantes might she have moved,</l>
<l>And with sweete words cause deafe rockes to have loved,</l>
<l>Worthy she was to move both Gods and men,</l>
<l>But neither was I man, nor lived then.</l>
<l>Can deafe eares take delight when <name>Phemius</name> sings,</l>
<l>Or <name>Thamiras</name> in curious painted things?</l>
<l>What sweete thought is there but I had the same?</l>
<l>And one gave place still as another came.</l>
<l>Yet notwithstanding, like one dead it lay,</l>
<l>Drouping more then a Rose puld yesterday:</l>
<l>Now when he should not jette, he boults upright,</l>
<l>And craves his taske, and seekes to be at fight.</l>
<l>Lie downe with shame, and see thou stirre no more,</l>
<l>Seeing now thou wouldst deceive me as before:</l>
<l>Thou cousenst mee, by thee surprizde am I,</l>
<l>And bide sore losse, with endlesse infamie.</l>
<l>Nay more, the wench did not disdaine a whit,</l>
<l>To take it in her hand and play with it.</l>
<l>But when she saw it would by no meanes stand,</l>
<l>But still droupt downe, regarding not her hand,</l>
<l>Why mockst thou me she cried, or being ill,</l>
<l>Who bad thee lie downe here against thy will?</l>
<l>Either th'art witcht with blood of frogs new dead,</l>
<l>Or jaded camst thou from some others bed.</l>
<l>With that her loose gowne on, from me she cast her,</l>

<l>Was divers waies distract with love, and shame.</l>
<l>Love conquer'd shame, the furrowes dry were bumd,</l>
<l>And come with least part of it selfe retumd.</l>
<l>When well-toss'd mattocks did the ground prepare,</l>
<l>Being fit broken with the crooked share,</l>
<l>And seedes were equally in large fields cast,</l>
<l>The plough-mans hopes were frustrate at the last.</l>
<l>The graine-rich goddesse in high woods did stray,</l>
<l>Her long haires eare-wrought garland fell away.</l>
<l>Onely was <name>Crete</name> fruitfull that plenteous yeare,</l>
<l>Where <name>Ceres</name> went each place was harvest there.</l>
<l><name>Ida</name> the seate of groves did sing with corne,</l>
<l>Which by the wild boare in the woods was shorne.</l>
<l>Law-giving <name>Minos</name> did such yeares desire;</l>
<l>And wisht the goddesse long might feele loves fire.</l>
<l><name>Ceres</name> what sports to thee so grievous were,</l>
<l>As in thy sacrifize we them forbeare?</l>
<l>Why am I sad, when <name>Proserpine</name> is found,</l>
<l>And <name>Juno</name> like with <name>Dis</name> raignes under ground?</l>

<argument lang="la"><p>Ad amicam, a cuius amore discedere non potest</p></argument>

<l>Long have I borne much, mad thy faults me make:</l>
<l>Dishonest love my wearied brest forsake,</l>
<l>Now have I freed my selfe, and fled the chaine,</l>
<l>And what I have borne, shame to beare againe.</l>
<l>We vanquish, and tread tam'd love under feete,</l>
<l>Victorious wreathes at length my Temples greete.</l>
<l>Suffer, and harden: good growes by this griefe,</l>
<l>Oft bitter juice brings to the sicke reliefe.</l>
<l>I have sustainde so oft thrust from the dore,</l>
<l>To lay my body on the hard moist floore.</l>
<l>I know not whom thou lewdly didst imbrace,</l>
<l>When I to watch supplyed a servants place.</l>
<l>I saw when forth a tyred lover went,</l>
<l>His side past service, and his courage spent.</l>
<l>Yet this is lesse, then if he had seene me,</l>
<l>May that shame fall mine enemies chance to be.</l>
<l>When have not I fixt to thy side close layed?</l>
<l>I have thy husband, guard, and fellow plaied.</l>
<l>The people by my company she pleasd,</l>
<l>My love was cause that more mens love she seazd.</l>
<l>What should I tell her vaine tongues filthy lyes,</l>
<l>And to my losse God-wronging perjuries?</l>
<l>What secret becks in banquets with her youths,</l>
<l>With privy signes, and talke dissembling truths?</l>
<l>Hearing her to be sicke, I thether ranne,</l>
<l>But with my rivall sicke she was not than.</l>
<l>These hardned me, with what I keepe obscure,</l>
<l>Some other seeke, who will these things endure.</l>
<l>Now my ship in the wished haven crownd,</l>
<l>With joy heares <name>Neptunes</name> swelling waters sound.</l>
<l>Leave thy once powerfull words, and flatteries,</l>
<l>I am not as I was before, unwise.</l>
<l>Now love, and hate my light brest each way move;</l>
<l>But victory, I thinke, will hap to love.</l>
<l>Ile hate, if I can; if not, love gainst my will:</l>
<l>Bulles hate the yoake, yet what they hate have still.</l>
<l>I flie her lust, but follow beauties creature;</l>
<l>I loath her manners, love her bodies feature.</l>
<l>Nor with thee, nor without thee can I live,</l>
<l>And doubt to which desire the palme to give.</l>
<l>Or lesse faire, or lesse lewd would thou mightst bee,</l>
<l>Beauty with lewdnesse doth right ill agree.</l>
<l>Her deeds game hate, her face entreateth love:</l>
<l>Ah, she doth more worth then her vices prove.</l>
<l>Spare me, O by our fellow bed, by all</l>
<l>The Gods who by thee to be perjurde fall,</l>
<l>And by thy face to me a powre divine,</l>
<l>And by thine eyes whose radiance burnes out mine.</l>
<l>What ere thou art mine art thou: choose this course,</l>
<l>Wilt have me willing, or to love by force?</l>
<l>Rather lie hoist up saile, and use the winde,</l>
<l>That I may love yet, though against my minde.</l>

<l>When fruite fild <name>Tuscia</name> should a wife give me,</l>
<l>We toucht the walles, <name>Camillus</name> wonne by thee.</l>
<l>The Priests to Juno did prepare chaste feasts,</l>
<l>With famous pageants, and their home-bred beasts.</l>
<l>To know their rites, well recompenc'd my stay,</l>
<l>Though thether leades a rough steepe hilly way.</l>
<l>There stands an old wood with thick trees darke clouded,</l>
<l>Who sees it, graunts some deity there is shrowded.</l>
<l>An Altar takes mens incense, and oblation,</l>
<l>An Altar made after the ancient fashion.</l>
<l>Here when the Pipe with solemne tunes doth sound,</l>
<l>The annuall pompe goes on the covered ground.</l>
<l>White Heifers by glad people forth are led,</l>
<l>Which with the grasse of <name>Tuscane</name> fields are fed.</l>
<l>And calves from whose feard front no threatning fiyes,</l>
<l>And little Piggs, base Hog-sties sacrifice,</l>
<l>And Rams with hornes their hard heads wreathed back.</l>
<l>Onely the Goddesse hated Goate did lack,</l>
<l>By whom disclosd, she in the high woods tooke,</l>
<l>Is said to have attempted flight forsooke.</l>
<l>Now is the goat brought through the boyes with darts,</l>
<l>And give to him that the first wound imparts.</l>
<l>Where <name>Juno</name> comes, each youth, and pretty maide,</l>
<l>Shew large wayes with their garments there displayed.</l>
<l>Jewels, and gold their Virgin tresses crowne,</l>
<l>And stately robes to their gilt feete hang downe.</l>
<l>As is the use, the Nunnes in white veyles clad,</l>
<l>Upon their heads the holy mysteries had.</l>
<l>When the chiefe pompe comes, lowd the people hollow,</l>
<l>And she her vestall virgin Priests doth follow.</l>
<l>Such was the <name>Greeke</name> pompe, <name>Agamemnon</name> dead,</l>

<l>Seeing thou art faire, I barre not thy false playing,</l>

<l>What madnesse ist to tell night prankes by day,</l>

<l>The strumpet with the stranger will not do,</l>

<l>And blush, and seeme as you were full of grace.</l>
<l>Deceive all, let me erre, and thinke I am right,</l>
<l>And like a wittall thinke thee voyde of slight.</l>
<l>Why see I lines so oft receivde and given,</l>
<l>This bed, and that by tumbling made uneven,</l>
<l>Like one start up your haire tost and displast,</l>
